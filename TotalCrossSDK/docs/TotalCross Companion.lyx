\begin_layout Standard
Welcome to TotalCross.
 This tutorial assumes that you know how to write Java programs.
 If not, I suggest that you take a basic course in Java at 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/index.html"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, you'll have to forget the JDK API and use the TotalCross API.
 Make a good read of the API javadocs: they will show you the differences
 between the JDK and the TotalCross API.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some conventions used in this tutorial:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When a code sample has ...
 (ellipses) between two parts, it means that some part of that code has
 been omitted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Measurements are always in 
\emph on
pixels
\emph default
, unless otherwise specified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tutorial follows the Object Oriented naming convention: a class containing
 methods (~functions) and properties or fields (~variables).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
WINDOWS CE
\series default
 refers to all the possible names deriving from that platform: Windows CE
 (up to 2.x), Pocket PC (Windows CE 3.x), .NET (Windows CE 4.x), Windows Mobile

\begin_layout Chapter
TotalCross Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thank you for your interest in TotalCross.
 If you don't know where to start, here's a quick overview of the platform:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Supported Platforms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Android 1.6 and above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
iOS 4.0 and above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
BlackBerry 4.3.0 and above.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Palm OS 5 with NVFS.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Windows CE: Pocket PC ARM/SH3/MIPS (3.0, .NET, Windows Mobile 5 and 6), PPC
 2.11 ARM, HPC2000 ARM.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Windows 2000 and above
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Linux.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Browser as Java applet (JDK 1.1 and above).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Virtual Machine Features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The TotalCross Virtual Machine (TCVM) is a shared library written from scratch,
 and has the following features: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It interprets a proprietary set of opcodes instead of Java Bytecodes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It is a register-based VM, not stack-based as Java, which results in better
 performance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It has support for real multi-threading.
 Note that the TotalCross API does not supports concurrency, which must
 be implemented by your own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The TotalCross class (tclass) files stores internal information in little
 endian, since its the most widely used format of actual microprocessors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The tclass files are highly optimized to save space.
 For instance, the constant pool (where Strings, constants and identifiers
 are stored) is shared among all deployed classes, and each class entry
 is compressed using zlib.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Supports headless applications (like daemon applications, without user interface
): just implement the interface 
\family typewriter
totalcross.MainClass
\family default
 and this class will be loaded by the TCVM.
 The 
\family typewriter
appStarting()
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
appEnding()
\family default
 methods are called and the application exits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Supports the method 
\family typewriter
finalize()
\family default
, ran every time the garbage collector (gc) finishes its job.
 There's a limitation: no objects can be created inside a finally method,
 otherwise the method will silently abort itself.
 Optionally, to improve GC's performance, you can define in your class a
 public non-static field named 
\family typewriter
dontFinalize
\family default
 that, if present and set to 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
, will skip the finalize call.
 In most cases, 
\family typewriter
finalize()
\family default
 is used to ensure that a class that holds system resources (like file or
 socket) and should be closed to release these resources is always closed,
 either because the programmer forgot to do it himself or because the program
 was halted by an exception.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Box Shadowbox

inner_pos "t"
use_parbox 0
use_makebox 0
width "100line%"
special "none"

height_special "totalheight"
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that you must define the field 
\family typewriter
dontFinalize
\family default
 and set it to 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
 when the close method is run for the first time.
 Otherwise the gc will try to finalize an object that was already closed
 by the programmer, which may cause trouble.
 Doing so also speeds up the gc.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
The TotalCross VM also has a drawback:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It does not support the 
\family typewriter
float
\family default
 type, only 
\family typewriter
double
\family default
.
 This option was adopted because all actual PDA processors have a math co-proces
sor, and also because the vast majority of mobile applications are not scientifi
c programs.
 During our research, we found that 
\family typewriter
float
\family default
 types are two times faster than double, but this small performance difference
 does not make up for the overhead needed to add 
\family typewriter
float
\family default
 type support to the virtual machine.
 The change from 
\family typewriter
float
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
double
\family default
 will be done by the translator to let legacy applications work, however,
 you should change your application to use 
\family typewriter
double
\family default
, since there's no benefit by using 
\family typewriter
float
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Thread support
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TotalCross supports preemptive threads using the native thread mechanism
 of each supported platform.
 On Android, iOS, and Linux, it uses pthread; on Palm OS, it uses the undocument
ed (and quite limited) thread api; on Windows, it uses the quite well documented
 thread api, in BlackBerry, it uses the Java's thread scheduler.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The API does not support concurrency.
 If your program needs to access the same object from many threads, you
 must use the 
\family typewriter
synchronized
\family default
 keyword.
 The support for synchronized is limited: it does not support synchronized
 methods, neither classes, neither standard objects.
 You must use the 
\family typewriter
synchronized(object)
\family default
, and the only object type that can be used as parameter is the 
\family typewriter
totalcross.util.concurrent.Lock
\family default
.
 If you use 
\family typewriter
synchronized(this)
\family default
, the 
\family typewriter
tc.Deploy
\family default
 will abort during deploy; if you use synchronized with an object from any
 other class besides the 
\family typewriter
Lock
\family default
 class, a 
\family typewriter
RuntimeException
\family default
 will be thrown when your program runs in the TotalCross virtual machine.
 Note that these problems will not occur when running on Java desktop, only
 when running on TCVM.
 Here's a sample that shows how to use it:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash
lstinputlisting[label=samplecode,caption=A sample]{companion_resources/listings/
TestConcurrent.java}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the sample above, commenting out the line marked with *****, the log
 list box will be filled randomly by the threads.
 With the lock, it will be filled in sequence, because each thread will
 gain the lock once, and the other threads will have to wait the main loop
 of the lock owner finish before starting their loops.
 There's no limit in the number of locks used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generally speaking, you can create a thread to listen to a socket or a file
 or even a Litebase table in background, but be aware that if you try to
 access the same resource by different threads your application might just
 blow up.
 We also don't recommend running the user interface in a background thread,
 due to system event concurrency.
 Threads should be used for I/O and other tasks, but not for showing user
 interface screens that could receive events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Graphics, Palette and Color
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TotalCross has a graphics engine written from scratch, and some important
 performance-tailored decisions were taken.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regardless of the device's color depth, the screen and images are stored
 in a 24 bpp RGB array.
 All drawings are made into a single off screen, which is then converted
 on the fly to the device's screen color depth when the 
\family typewriter
updateScreen()
\family default
 method is called.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the screen is 8 bpp, a variant of the 685 palette (6 bits for red, 8
 for green and 5 for blue, plus 16 shades of gray) is used.
 (see Appendix C – 685 palette).
 Note: since 2011, no devices with 8 bpp are released to the market; all
 of them use 16 bpp (65536 colors).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
Graphics
\family default
 class supports real clipping, which allowed us to support containers that
 automatically show scrollbars if components are placed beyond its limits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TotalCross also supports screen rotation and collapsible input area.
 If the user interface is implemented using only relative coordinates, it
 will automatically reposition itself whenever the screen resolution is
 changed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Box Shadowbox
position "t"
hor_pos "c"
has_inner_box 1
inner_pos "t"
use_parbox 0
use_makebox 0
width "100line%"
special "none"
height "1in"
height_special "totalheight"
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Note that 
\family typewriter
aControl.setRect(getClientRect())
\family default
 should never be used, otherwise the automatic repositioning will not work.
 Instead, 
\family typewriter
aControl.setRect(LEFT, TOP, FILL, FILL)
\family default
 should be used to produce the same result without affecting the repositioning.
 If you really have to use 
\family typewriter
getClientRect()
\family default
, you must also override the 
\family typewriter
reposition()
\family default
 method to support screen rotation.
 (see the WorldWatch sample).
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Colors are represented by 
\family typewriter
int
\family default
 values in the 
\family typewriter
0xRRGGBB
\family default
 format.
 A 
\family typewriter
null
\family default
 color is represented by the value -1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Images
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Images in TotalCross supports transparency (also known as alpha-channel).
 The best way to show images is to generate a PNG image from a vectorized
 image through Photoshop or any other good editor.
 Prefer creating a big image (for example, 96x96), then decrease its size
 at runtime using 
\family typewriter
Image.getSmoothScaledInstance
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Inheritance and Delegation event models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TotalCross supports both Inheritance (Java 1.0) and Delegation (Java 1.1)
 event models.
 However, the usage of the later one is not recommended.
 The Inheritance model will make your code smaller and faster, but there
 are some situations that require the usage of the Delegation model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Security
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TotalCross applications are currently impossible to be decompiled, because,
 as mentioned before, TotalCross uses a proprietary set of opcodes instead
 of Java Bytecodes.
 The translation between Java Bytecodes to TotalCross opcodes is done automatica
lly when the application is deployed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, this also means that you cannot retrieve your application's source
 files from the deployed application, so don't forget to backup your source
 files!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Getting Started
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Be sure to read the API javadocs at 
\family typewriter
TotalCrossSDK/docs/html/index.html
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Box Shadowbox
position "t"
hor_pos "c"
has_inner_box 1
inner_pos "t"
use_parbox 0
use_makebox 0
width "100line%"
special "none"
height "1in"
height_special "totalheight"
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The javadocs and this reference manual are complementary, and the javadocs
 are updated more often than this text.
 So make sure to read them for more information.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are some examples in the 
\family typewriter
TotalCrossSDK/src/java/tc/samples
\family default
 directories.
 These samples covers the usage of a great portion of TotalCross' class
 library, so it's a good source of information from where you can start
 your applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our official forum (
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "http://forum.totalcross.net"

\end_inset

) is a good place to seek for help from fellow TotalCross users and share
 your knowledge.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Bug Reporting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you'd like to report a bug or problem within the TotalCross SDK – including,
 but not limited to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Documentation problems, grammar errors or typos.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
TotalCross platform bug.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Sample bug.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should first take a look at the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "TotalCross changelog"
target "http://www.superwaba.com.br/en/changelogs.asp"

\end_inset

 and check if your bug was already fixed on a later version of the TotalCross
 SDK.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may then use the forum to report the bug, however, its not guaranteed
 that we will fix the bug.
 If you want the bug fixed in a few days and receive a fixed virtual machine,
 you must purchase a 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "support plan"
target "http://www.superwaba.com.br/en/suporte.asp"

\end_inset

 at the site.

\begin_layout Chapter
The TotalCross SDK
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The TotalCross SDK Java files are covered by the LGPL version 3.
 By installing the SDK you are agreeing with this.
 The TotalCross virtual machine follows another license.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The VM provided in the SDK is a demo version.
 It will work for 80 non-contiguous hours, regardless of the platform.
 The remaining time is updated every 5 seconds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On devices, performing a hard-reset allows you to reinstall the VM and have
 more 80 hours to test.
 This is NOT considered a license violation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On Win32 (Windows 2000, XP, Vista or Seven), this can only be done by reformatti
ng your hard drive and reinstalling Windows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to deploy applications, the JDK 1.6 or higher is required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In most situations, you will install several programs that will share the
 same TCVM.
 For instance, you can install 10 or more samples and a single virtual machine.
 However, if you're deploying an application to your costumer, you can package
 the VM with your application, using the 
\family typewriter
tc.Deploy
\family default
's 
\family typewriter
/p
\family default
 option.
 In this case, a single package is needed.

\begin_layout Section
Running the Samples
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The TotalCross SDK comes with various sample applications along with their
 source code.
 The samples are simple and most of them address a specific feature.
 They were designed to show you the TotalCross main features and to provide
 a starting point for your own applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The built samples can be found on 
\family typewriter
TotalCrossSDK/dist/samples
\family default
.
 Just follow the installation instructions from chapter 6 and run the sample
 on your target platform.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Building and deploying your first TotalCross application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TotalCross applications are developed almost exactly like Java applications,
 so anyone familiar with Java should be able to start small TotalCross applicati
ons in a few minutes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, this similarity is often also source of problems, so before writing
 any code, we must first be aware of the differences between Java and TotalCross
 development.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The entry point of a TotalCross application is always a class that extends
 the class 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

MainWindow
\family default
 (directly or indirectly, such as 
\family typewriter
Conduit
\family default
) or implements the interface 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

MainClass
\family default
.
 It is not possible to directly run TotalCross applications in Java, in
 this case, you must use the lLauncher provided with the SDK.
 (see Chapter 4 for details about 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

totalcross.Launcher
\family default
)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For your convenience, the TotalCross package 
\family typewriter
totalcross.lang
\family default
 is directly mapped to the Java package 
\family typewriter
java.lang
\family default
.
 Therefore, you may refer to classes from this package, such as 
\family typewriter
Object
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
String
\family default
, like you would in any Java application, without requiring any explicit
 import.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately this feature can be misleading, because the opposite is NOT
 true.
 The 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

java.lang
\family default
 package does have members (interfaces, classes, exceptions or errors) that
 are not available in 
\family typewriter
totalcross.lang
\family default
 – and some of the members that are available, may not implement all the
 methods provided by the homonymous member.
 Some examples are the 
\family typewriter
Integer
\family default
 class and the method 
\family typewriter
String.split()
\family default
, which are not implemented by TotalCross.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is one of the most common pitfalls when developing TotalCross applications
 using a Java IDE, because its content assist will show classes and methods
 that are not implemented by TotalCross, and therefore, not available on
 the device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To avoid this problem, the TotalCross deployer verifies the class files,
 reporting any invalid references found.
 The deployer will throw an exception if you try to deploy an application
 with references to classes not available in 
\family typewriter
totalcross.lang
\family default
.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
TotalCross is compatible only with the Java 1.1 class file format, therefore
 the class files MUST be generated targeting the JDK 1.1 and the source files
 must be compatible with JDK 1.2.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
If you're compiling using 
\family typewriter
javac
\family default
 from command line (or an ANT file), add this to your command line: 
\family typewriter
-target 1.1 -source 1.2
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you're using a Java IDE, look for its Java Compiler settings and set
 its compliance level to 1.3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again, the deployer will throw an exception if it detects an invalid class
 file format.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Section
Building a sample application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For our first application, let's make a typical “Hello World” application
 using just your preferred plain text editor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, make sure you have a JDK installed (preferably the JDK 6) and the
 environment variables are set.
 There should be a JAVA_HOME variable set with the installation path of
 your JDK, like 
\family typewriter
C:
\backslash
Program Files
\backslash
Java
\backslash
jdk1.6.0_11
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And another variable named PATH, which should contain a list of paths, separated
 by semicolons, with the path to the JDK's bin directory, like 
\family typewriter
%JAVA_HOME%
\backslash
bin
\family default
.
 If you don't do this, you will get the error: 
\family typewriter
[preverify] JAR file creation failed with error -1
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may also add the path to the TotalCross 
\family typewriter
.jar
\family default
 file (located in 
\family typewriter
TotalCrossSDK/dist/tc.
 jar
\family default
) to your CLASSPATH environment variable (or create one if the variables
 does not exists).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Box Shadowbox

use_parbox 0
use_makebox 0
width "100line%"
special "none"
height "1in"
height_special "totalheight"

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The usage of the CLASSPATH variable is usually not advised, because it may
 cause conflicts when different classes share the same package structure.
 Creating an ANT build file and using the command line option 
\family typewriter
-classpath
\family default
 is a better choice.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Open your text editor and write the code below, saving the file as

Don't worry about understanding the code, this will be covered later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now open a command shell at the directory where the 
\family typewriter
HelloWorld.java
\family default
 was saved, and execute the following command:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
javac -target 1.1 -source 1.2 HelloWorld.java

use_makebox 0
width "100col%"
special "none"
height "1in"
height_special "totalheight"
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Remember, if you preferred to not use the CLASSPATH variable, you must ALWAYS
 specify the path to the 
\family typewriter
tc.jar
\family default
 file using the 
\family typewriter
-classpath
\family default
 option, like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\family typewriter
javac -classpath C:
\backslash
TotalCrossSDK
\backslash
dist
\backslash
tc.jar -target 1.1 -source 1.2 HelloWorld.java
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Otherwise, the Java compiler won't be able to find the TotalCross classes
 used by the application.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If successful, the Java compiler should finish silently, creating a new
 file named 
\family typewriter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Running with the Launcher (on JDK)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the launcher, we can run our application and take alook at the result.
 Using a command shell, execute the following command:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
java -classpath .;%CLASSPATH% totalcross.Launcher HelloWorld
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here we are executing the Java application 
\family typewriter

height "1in"
height_special "totalheight"
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In this case, the usage of the option 
\family typewriter
-classpath
\family default
 is needed because the 
\family typewriter
HelloWorld.class
\family default
 is not in a valid package directory structure, so we must add the current
 folder to the classpath.
\end_layout

Deploying and running on Win32
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The launcher provided us a quick way to look at our application's appearance,
 but that's still a Java application.
 To actually deploy our application to all platforms supported by TotalCross,
 go back to the command shell and execute this command:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
java tc.Deploy HelloWorld -all
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 option with the 
\family typewriter
tc.jar
\family default
 path if you're not using the CLASSPATH environment variable.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This time, we are executing the program 
\family typewriter
tc.Deploy
\family default
, passing the name of our main class as the first argument, and the platforms
 to deploy as the second argument – in this case all platforms.
 (see Chapter 5 for more information about the Deployment process).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A new folder named 
\family typewriter
install
\family default
 will be created, and inside it you should find several folders, each one
 containing the installer (or the executable) for each supported platform.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We should be able now to run the Win32 version of our application, so let's
 move to 
\family typewriter
./install/ win32
\family default
 and run the executable 
\family typewriter

\family default
, which should look like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Float figure

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The default screen size is 240x320.
 You can change the screen size and position by editing the 
\family typewriter
.exe
\family default
 shortcut and adding the parameter 
\family typewriter
/scr x,y,width,height
\family default
.
 The possible values are: -1 to use the default and -2 to center on screen.
 Ex: "
\family typewriter
/scr -2,100,320,-1
\family default
" will open a window horizontally centered at y=100, w=320, h=320 (default
 is 0,0,240,320).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Some people think that running the application on the desktop under an IDE
 (such as Eclipse or Netbeans) or on BlackBerry will use the TotalCross
 virtual machine.
 This is not true: the actual virtual machine used is the one provided in
 the Java Development Kit installed (or 
\family typewriter
java.exe
\family default
) on the desktop and a virtual machine based on J2ME on BlackBerry.

Deployment Process
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To deploy your TotalCross application, you must use the Java application
 named 
\family typewriter
tc.Deploy
\family default
, packaged with the 
\family typewriter
tc.jar
\family default
 located at 
\family typewriter
TotalCrossSDK/dist
\family default
.

status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To run a Java application from a jar file, you must specify the source 
\family typewriter
.jar
\family default
 to the Java classpath, e.g.
 
\family typewriter
java -classpath C:
\backslash
TotalCrossSDK
\backslash
dist
\backslash
tc.jar tc.Deploy […]
\family default
.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
tc.Deploy
\family default
 program will, starting in the working directory, create folders with the
 installation files for each platform.
 A 
\family typewriter
.tcz
\family default
 file is outputted with all classes and its dependencies, already translated
 to the target opcodes, and compressed with ZLib to save space.
 We recommend that the original classes are compiled with debug information,
 because line numbers will be included in the 
\family typewriter
.tcz
\family default
 and will be available in the stack trace (all other debug information are
 discarded).
 
\family typewriter
.bmp
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
.gif
\family default
 files are automatically converted to 24bpp 
\family typewriter
.png
\family default
 files (JPeg are kept in its original format – read more about images below).
 The 
\family typewriter
.tcz
\family default
 file is not compliant with the 
\family typewriter
.zip
\family default
 format, although ZLib is used, because we need to store more information
 in the 
\family typewriter
.tcz
\family default
 file.
 Note that, since we translate the programs to our opcodes, there's no need
 to run obfuscators in the class file, because obfuscation is already done
 by the converter.
 Actually, 
\family typewriter
.tcz
\family default
 files are 1/4 of the original class size, 50% due to our tclass file format
 and 50% more due to the ZLib compression.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Parameters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic format is: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
tc.Deploy <application/library to deploy> <target platforms> [other options]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
<application/library to deploy>
\family default
 must be one of the following:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The main class file name (the 
\family typewriter
.class
\family default
, not the 
\family typewriter
.java
\family default
).
 You can pass the full path to the main class file instead of its fully
 qualified name (
\family typewriter
App
\family default
 x 
\family typewriter
my.sample.App
\family default
).
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

For example, to deploy 
\family typewriter
my.sample.App
\family default
 at 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

C:/myprogram/classes/my/sample/App.class
\family default

or
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family typewriter

The correct package is automatically detected from the class file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The folder that contains a single class that implements

\family default
 or 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

GameEngineMainWindow
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
This option will not work if your main class extends a class which in turn
 extends one of the classes listed above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For instance:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming 
\family typewriter
App
\family default
 is the main class, “
\family typewriter
MainWindow
\family default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Leftarrow$
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter

\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
AnotherClass
\family default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Leftarrow$
\end_inset

 
\family typewriter
App
\family default
” will not work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This option will also fail if the given folder contains more than one valid
 main class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The deployer automatically detects and includes 
\family typewriter
Class.forName()
\family default
 references.

 or 
\family typewriter
tc.Deploy App.zip
\family default
 (a 
\family typewriter
.jar
\family default
 file is basically a 
\family typewriter
.zip
\family default
 file with a new extension).
 To create a 
\family typewriter
.jar
\family default
 file, open the command prompt, change to the class files folder (usually
 
\family typewriter
/bin
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
/classes
\family default
), and type: 
\family typewriter
jar cvf App.jar
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Please notice this is the only option that does not require a main class
 to be used, therefore, it's the only valid option to create libraries (which
 usually does not have a main class).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, if you use this option to deploy an application, the 
\family typewriter
.jar/.zip
\family default
 file must have the same name of the main class.
 (e.g.
 if your main class is 
\family typewriter
App.class
\family default
, the resulting 
\family typewriter
.jar/.zip
\family default
 file must be either 
\family typewriter

 the time-limited demonstration, or the release that requires activation).
 The DEMO SDKs must be in the path or in the TOTALCROSS_HOME/ LITEBASE_HOME
 environment variables, and the RELEASE SDKs must be in the same parent
 folder of the DEMO ones.
 Example: if TOTALCROSS_HOME points to

\family typewriter
rim_root
\family default
 is the path to the BlackBerry JDE or BlackBerry Component Package root
 directory.
 If not specified, 
\family typewriter
tc.Deploy

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
rim_class_path
\family default
 is the set of paths to search for BlackBerry libraries (
\family typewriter
.jar

 files).
 This path must include the BlackBerry library (
\family typewriter
net_rim_api.jar
\family default
), the TotalCross for BlackBerry (
\family typewriter
TotalCross.jar
\family default
) and any other TotalCross libraries needed by your application (like Litebase,
 for example).
 If not specified, 
\family typewriter
tc.Deploy

 will search for libraries only under the default library directory: 
\family typewriter
rim.root/lib
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
application
\family default
 is the path to the main class of your application, or the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the optional parameter 
\family typewriter
/s
\family default
 is specified, 
\family typewriter
tc.Deploy
\family default
 will automatically open the SignatureTool after the TotalCross application
 or library has been deployed, so you can type the password (you may also
 give the password as a parameter to

).
 It is important to say that the two signature files (see the Signature
 section for details) must be placed under the 
\family typewriter
TotalCrossSDK/etc/tools/bb/bin
\family default
 directory, otherwise the deployer will claim that no signature key was
 found.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Installation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To install a TotalCross application or library on BlackBerry devices or
 the simulators, first you have to deploy it.
 Then, make sure

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Desktop installation method is pretty straightforward.
 In the BlackBerry Desktop Software, open the “Application Loader” and follow
 the instructions.
 When the list box containing all the applications that are currently installed
 on the device is displayed, click “Add…”, select the
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family typewriter
<application_name>.alx
\family default
 file and confirm.
 The selected application should appear on the list.
 If so, click “Next” and wait until the process is finished.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You must always install 
\family typewriter
TotalCross.cod
\family default
, then 
\family typewriter
Litebase.cod
\family default
, then your application's 
\family typewriter
.cod
\family default
 file.
 If you don't follow this order, you will have problems.
 It is also possible to install the above three modules at the same time
 using BlackBerry Desktop Software.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Signature
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before a TotalCross application can be installed on a BlackBerry device
 it is necessary to sign its module using the SignatureTool and the keys
 provided by RIM – Research In Motion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you do not have the signature keys, you must request them directly to
 RIM.
 More information can be found here: http://na.blackberry.com/eng/developers/javaa
ppdev/codekeys.jsp (if this link is broken, go to www.blackberry.com, click
 Developers at the top row, then click “Java Application Development” at
 the left menu, and then “Development Tools and Downloads”) .
 After receiving and registering your keys in your computer, you will see
 the two key files in your BlackBerry JDE or BlackBerry Component Package
 root directory: 
\family typewriter
sigtool.csk
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
sigtool.db
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Signing a TotalCross application or library is the same as signing any other
 BlackBerry application: you must open SignatureTool (the RIM signature
 application) and load the application 
\family typewriter
.cod
\family default
 module.
 Then, click request, type your password and wait until the signing process
 is finished.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can also automatically sign TotalCross applications or libraries during
 the deployment process.
 To do this, you must specify the option 
\family typewriter
/s
\family default
 when running 
\family typewriter
tc.Deploy
\family default
 (see the Deployment section for details).

\begin_layout Standard
When prompted for a password, just hit enter and leave it empty.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now you must go back to the iOS Provisioning Portal to create a new mobile
 provision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the iOS Provisioning Portal, go to "App IDs" to create an id for your
 application.
 Make sure to double check everything when creating ids because once created
 they cannot be removed! (There's no limit to the number of app ids you
 can have, but you don't want to end up with dozens of unused ids cluttering
 your page.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this first time, I suggest you to use the wildcard app id that should
 come configured by default.
 (If you don't have it, just create one using * as Bundle Identifier)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now move on to Provisioning, switch to the Distribution tab and click on
 "New Profile".
 In "Distribution Method" choose "In House", and use the same distribution
 certificate and app ids you already created.
 Name it and after submitting use the download option in the Distribution
 tab to download it to the same folder where you have your certificate and
 keystore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mobile provision allows only the application with the specified id to
 run on the device.
 If you create the mobile provision using the wildcard app id, it will allow
 any application signed by you to work on the device, making it very useful
 for testing your applications without creating additional ids that can't
 be later removed.

To install a TotalCross application on iPhone, you have two choices: perform
 a manual installation or support the package manager named “Cydia”.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the iOS is jailbroken, most programs have problems to keep the wifi
 connection working.
 We found an easy way to bypass this: all you have to do is ping the device.
 The best way to do this is to give your iOS device a fixed ip.
 Suppose it is 192.168.2.100; open a command prompt, and type: 
\family typewriter
ping 192.168.2.100 -n 1000000
\family default
.
 This will keep pinging the device 1 million times.
 If at the start of the ping you get that the ip is unreachable, open any
 URL at Safari on the device.
 Note that the device's wifi will continue to work even if the screen is

Debugging
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Starting in version 1.15, on Windows Mobile, it is possible to find exactly
 where an error, that results in a critical stop, occured.
 This can help a lot to fix problems in the virtual machine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the program starts, the virtual machine makes two changes in the Windows
 Mobile registry, enabling the error reporting, but disabling the dialog
 that appears when such error occurs.
 This way, the crash dumps are kept in place, allowing us to recover it.
 It's throught this crash dump that we can now find the exact point where
 the error occured (in both TotalCross and Litebase VMs).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
See what you have to do when a critical error happens:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Go to the folder

Deployment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How to deploy your application to Android:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
java tc.Deploy .....
 -android (or -all)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A directory named 
\family typewriter
install
\backslash
android
\family default
 will be created with a single 
\family typewriter
.apk
\family default
 inside.
 This 
\family typewriter
.apk
\family default
 contains your application's TCZ and the launcher.
 You can install additional files by creating an 
\family typewriter
android.pkg
\family default
 (or 
\family typewriter
all.pkg
\family default
).
 The deployer will search for a file named 
\family typewriter
icon72x72.png
\family default
 as a special icon for it (remember to use alpha channel in the PNG for
 better appearance); if it doesn't find the file, it will resize the 
\family typewriter
appicon.gif
\family default
 (already used in other platforms) to 72x72 and use it.
 The first time that TotalCross, Litebase and your application run, it will
 take longer because the 
\family typewriter
.tcz
\family default
 (and possibly other libraries) will be being decompressed and installed
 in the application's data folder.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
IMPORTANT: In Android you can only read/write from 
\family typewriter
Settings.appPath
\family default
 (which is 
\family typewriter
/data/ data/totalcross.app.<your application name here>
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
/data/data/
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

totalcross.app.<application id>
\family default
 if using single package).
 Trying to load from anything else will fail with permission error.
 You can't even list the files from elsewhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Installing on the Device
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ADB (Android Debugging Bridge) is the tool that is used to install applicati
ons in the device, and also to get the log from it.
 This tool is released with the TotalCross SDK and is located at 
\family typewriter
TotalCrossSDK
\backslash
etc
\backslash
tools
\backslash
android
\family default
.
 If you plan to use it from the command-line, add it to the PATH environment
 variable of your computer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Be sure that the Android device is connected to USB and that the driver
 was installed.
 To be able to find if the Android device is ok, type (from cmd):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
adb devices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the device is ok, it will be listed (like this):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
List of devices attached
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
HT9A3LV00045 device
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The number above is the serial number of the device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To install the file in the device, you can use:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
adb install -r xxx.apk
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note: if you're running on Windows and installed 
\family typewriter
TotalCrossSDK.exe
\family default
, the 
\family typewriter
setup.bat
\family default
 file at the root has created a registry entry that adds an “Install APK”
 file to the right-button click in Windows Explorer.
 This greatly helps installing any application in the device.
 So, just open Windows Explorer, select the APK file, right-click your mouse
 button, and select “Install APK”.
 The file will then be downloaded to the device.
 Note that the registry key adds this menu option to all file types, so,
 be careful to use it only with 
\family typewriter
.apk
\family default
 files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, if you want to test the 
\family typewriter
UIGadgets.apk
\family default

Vm.debug(Vm.ALTERNATIVE_DEBUG)
\family default
.
 Open the command prompt and type:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
adb logcat TotalCross:I *:S

\begin_layout Standard
You can use the 
\family typewriter
.bat
\family default
 file located at: 
\family typewriter
etc/tools/android/debug_console.bat
\family default

 It greatly helps debugging.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If, for some reason, the application crashes, do this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
adb bugreport >bug.txt
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then zip this 1MB file and send to us.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Using the Release Vms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you decide to release the application to your client, you must purchase
 TotalCross+Litebase licenses.
 See the correct approach going to the SuperWaba 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "site"
target "http://www.superwaba.com.br"

\end_inset

 and clicking the buy item at the horizontal menu.
 Once we detect the payment, we will then create an activation key and enable
 it at the site.
 Login in the account and press the “Check activation keys and licenses”.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The SuperWaba site has two types of accounts: one for the user that downloads
 the SDK, and one for the user that purchases licenses.
 They can even have the same e-mail, however, the passwords are necessarily
 different.
 The account that is used to download the SDK cannot see the activation
 VMs, however, the account that is used to download the activation VMs can
 see both.
 So, if you login using the SDK user and password, you will NOT be able
 to download the VMs, neither see the “Check activation keys and licenses”
 submenu.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have lots of costumers, you can create new activation keys and transfer
 credits between them.
 All this can be done at the site.
 Note that an activation key cannot be deleted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More information can be found at the SuperWaba site, under the Products
 menu.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Signing your application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you get access to the activation key, you must sign your application
 with it, using the deploy's 
\family typewriter
/r
\family default
 option.
 Just do something like:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
java tc.Deploy … /r <activation key>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Activating your application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After you login with the right account, download the TotalCross VMS package.
 This package is complimentary to the TotalCross SDK: it only contains special
 virtual machines that will authenticate to our server (hosted at Rackspace
 – Boston USA) at the first time that the application runs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The VM uses the port 80 and connects a to webservice located at www.superwaba.net
 server.
 So, if you're behind a firewall or a proxy, remember to allow connections
 to this site.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first time that the application runs at the device, it generates a file
 named 
\family typewriter
tcreq.pdb
\family default
 at the application's folder, containing the IMEI and the serial number.
 Then it connects to the server and, if succeed, replaces the file with
 a 
\family typewriter
tcsuc.pdb
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the device is hard-reseted (looses everything), a new connection to the
 server will be made once the program runs again.
 However, a new license will NOT be consumed, since the device was already
 activated once.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you upgrade the device's firmware, the serial number may change.
 In this case, when a new activation is done, it will consume a new license,
 since the information that is used to track the device was changed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The license is per-device.
 If the device is stolen, broken, or the costumer replaces it by another
 one, a new license is consumed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There's a special contract that can be made with us that will allow you
 to replace a device and return the license.
 Contact us at the site if you desire to be covered by this special agreement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some devices may not have an IMEI nor a serial number accessible by software.
 On these devices, a hard-reset will result in the consumption of one more
 key.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you sign your application with two activation keys, the license will
 be discounted again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Manual Activation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you don't have internet connection from the device, you can do a manual

Using a third server to control licenses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that you release your signed application to the customer and he
 starts spreading the application to other people.
 We created a way to allow a company to control which costumers will use
 the activated VM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can instruct the VM to call a custom webservice created by yourself.
 This webservice will process the login/password to allow or deny the activation
, and then will call our webservice which will return data to the application
 running at the device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Follow these steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Download the webservice 
\begin_inset CommandInset href

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the folder “Sample Webservice” there's a class named 
\family typewriter
ActivationService
\family default
, which is an Axis webservice created in Java (like the sample in this companion

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
You can host the webservice in any kind of server, such as Tomcat, .NET and
 Ruby.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
In the folder "Sample Application", there's a sample application named Activatio
nTest.
 Change the 
\family typewriter
Settings.activationServerURI
\family default
 field (at your application's static initializer!) to point to your webservice,
 and make the deploy using the 
\family typewriter
build_sdk.bat
\family default
 (demo version) or 
\family typewriter
build_vms.bat
\family default
 (release version).
 In 
\family typewriter
build_vms.bat
\family default
, change the KEY to your activation key.
 Execute the application to see the results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You can change the file 
\family typewriter
activation.html
\family default
 as you wish, but the property 
\family typewriter
name
\family default
 of the confirmation button must be 
\family typewriter
SubmitActivation
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Besides the 
\family typewriter
activation.html
\family default
, there are three optional files: 
\family typewriter
activation_success.
 html
\family default
 (which is shown if the activation succeeds), 
\family typewriter
activation_error.html
\family default
 (shown if the server rejects the activation), and 
\family typewriter
activation_nointernet.html
\family default
 (a test is made before calling the webservice to make sure that there's
 internet, if there's not, this page is shown).
 This way you can customize all messages in your own language.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
From your webservice, you can check the data that was received and you may
 return an error message to interrupt the activation.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

So, this is a summary of what you have to do in your application:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Specify the address of the webservice using 
\family typewriter
Settings.activationServerURI
\family default
 (and optionally also the namespace using 
\family typewriter
Settings.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

activationServerNamespace
\family default
).
 This must be done inside the static initializer of your main class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Optionally, if you want to create a custom screen to show at startup, follow
 the instructions described previously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Note that its impossible to run any code from your application before the
 activation.
 The only possible way to show a custom screen is from the 
\family typewriter
.html
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Your webservice must obey the given interface:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family typewriter
public static String[] activate(String request, String[] keys, String[]
 values) throws Exception
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The request parameter cannot be changed and must be passed to our webservice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The keys and values contains some basic information used by the activation,
 such as the device model, the serial number, the IMEI, and also any other
 parameters defined in the 
\family typewriter
.html
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After you apply your own logic to confirm if this is a valid user (like
 checking the login and password), you must connect to our webservice, sending
 the request string as parameter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The return of this method must be:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If error: an array with a single element with the error message that will
 be displayed to the user (like new 
\family typewriter
String[]{“Invalid password
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

}
\family default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If success: a two dimensional array, where the first element is a message
 that will be displayed to the user, and the second element is the answer
 received from our server.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Attention: the activation server that this webservice uses is our production
 server, so, one credit will be consumed each time that the activation succeeds
 in a computer that was never activated.
 In other words, be aware that your tests will consume a license.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
SuperWaba to TotalCross conversion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to make the conversion easier, we created a program, 
\family typewriter
tc.tools.SW2TC
\family default
 (included in 
\family typewriter
tc.jar
\family default
), which recursively reads a set of folders and change the names of the
 old SuperWaba packages, classes and methods to the new ones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This program does not create a backup, it simply overwrites the original
 files, so you should backup your files before running the program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This converter takes care of about 99% of the problems, remaining only 1%
 for you to manually update.
 Also, the program is just a token replacer, therefore, it cannot find that
 in "xxx.yyy", xxx is a ListBox nor a hotdog, so it cannot replace tokens
 based on the type.

\begin_layout Section
General Tips
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some important tips to finish the conversion after running the SW2TC:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
SW2TC cannot change some method names, refer to the javadocs for the new
 name of these methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The return type of some methods were changed, most of them used to return
 a 
\family typewriter
boolean
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
int
\family default
 value to indicate success or failure and now return 
\family typewriter
void
\family default
.
 Errors handling is done with exceptions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Many methods now throw checked exceptions, which must be handled accordingly.
 In SuperWaba, there were almost no validation on the arguments passed to
 the methods; in TotalCross, nearly all methods perform argument validation,
 throwing the appropriate exception for each case (in the future, this will
 be extended to all arguments and methods).
 To easily display the exception to the user, you can use the static method
 
\family typewriter
MessageBox.showException
\family default
.
 Read the tip described in the next section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
ALWAYS handle the exceptions thrown.
 Ignoring exceptions or simply logging the error without handling the exception
 is just wrong.
 Also remember that unchecked exceptions are usually caused by bad programming
 and are not supposed to be caught, unless you're using an unchecked exception
 instead of testing a condition.

\begin_layout Itemize
Some packages and classes were removed or changed, like the 
\family typewriter
datergf
\family default
 package and the 
\family typewriter
IntVector(DataStream)
\family default
 constructor.
 Most of them can be easily replaced by other classes or methods on TotalCross.
 But if needed, you may grab their code from SuperWaba, convert to TotalCross
 and add to your project.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
Color
\family default
 is now an 
\family typewriter
int
\family default
, in the format 0xRRGGBB.
 Change all 
\family typewriter
Color
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
int
\family default
.
 Instead of comparing or initializing the color to null, use -1.

end{lstlisting}
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The method 
\family typewriter
isOpen()
\family default
 was removed from all streams.
 Their constructors now throw an 
\family typewriter
IOException
\family default
 (or a subclass of it, like 
\family typewriter
FileNotFoundException
\family default
) if the operation fails.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In SuperWaba some classes had a 
\family typewriter
lastError
\family default
 field that had a platform dependent error code; in TotalCross this field
 no longer exists, the exception message contains a platform dependent error
 message identifying the error.
 This error message is provided by the underlying OS and may not be as helpful
 as expected, but it's still better than an error value.
 If the OS is unable to find a given error code on its error table, the
 exception message will have only the error code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The methods 
\family typewriter
onStart()
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
onAdd()
\family default
 were respectively renamed to 
\family typewriter
initUI()
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

onAddAgain()
\family default
.
 The SW2TC should perform these changes, but if the screen appears blank
 for some reason, check if the method 
\family typewriter
onStart()
\family default
 was not renamed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\family typewriter
WINDOW_MOVED
\family default
 event was removed.
 It was usually used to update the 
\family typewriter
myg
\family default
 (my Graphics) object.
 Now the correct approach is to do a 
\family typewriter
getGraphics()
\family default
 in all places 
\family typewriter
myg
\family default
 was used.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
Settings.onDevice
\family default
 is now called 
\family typewriter
onJavaSE
\family default
 (Standard Edition), but notice it has the opposite meaning! Be sure to
 search for this field and make sure it is being used correctly.
 For instance:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family typewriter
if (Settings.onDevice)
\family default
 replaced 
\family typewriter
for if(!Settings.onJavaSE)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All classes that extend 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
 must explicitly set 
\family typewriter
focusTraversable = true
\family default
 in the constructor, otherwise the class will not be able to receive focus
 using the keyboard in penless devices.
 This flag defaults to true in SuperWaba, but to false in TotalCross.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Correct way to handle Exceptions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We decided to write this to explain to programmers how to deal with exceptions.
 It does not apply only to TotalCross, but also to all other languages that
 make use of exceptions.
 One of the main differences between SuperWaba and TotalCross is the dispatch
 of exceptions by the API.
 Careless programmers tend to code this way:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

try
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	File f = new File(...);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

catch (Exception e){}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In other words, just ignore the exception that is being thrown.
 A programmer that codes this way should be fired for carelessness.
 A variation of this approach is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

try
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

catch (Exception e)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	Vm.debug("An exception was thrown");
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here the programmer informs itself that the exception was thrown but completely
 ignores crucial information that can help to resolve the problem.
 And he will see the exception only if he opens the 
\family typewriter
DebugConsole.txt
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second error is to handle exceptions in the same method it was thrown,
 like in this sample:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

class Report
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	File f;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	void createReport()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		createFile();
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		runReport();
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	void createFile()
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	try
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		f = new File("report.txt", File.CREATE_EMPTY);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	catch (Exception e)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		e.printStackTrace();
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What's the problem here? Simple: the 
\family typewriter
createReport()
\family default
 method is unable to confirm that the file was created or failed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, what's the correct way? The correct implementation is always throw the
 exception to the caller, and this to its caller, and so on, until you reach
 a root method that cannot pass the exception along, like the 
\family typewriter
initUI()
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
onEvent()
\family default
 methods (since these methods are overriden and you cannot change the method's
 signature).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Therefore, the correct implementation is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

class Report
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	File f;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	void createReport() throws IOException
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		createFile();
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		runReport();
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	void createFile() throws IOException
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		f = new File("report.txt", File.CREATE_EMPTY);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Implementing this way, in the root method, we would do:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

try 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	createReport();
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

} 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

catch (Exception e)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	MessageBox.showException(e,true);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

} 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that this approach is not yet perfect, because the 
\family typewriter
createFile()
\family default
 method is throwing 
\family typewriter
Exception
\family default
, while 
\family typewriter
new File()
\family default
 throws three exceptions: 
\family typewriter
IllegalArgumentIOException
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
FileNotFoundException
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
IOException
\family default
.
 Hence, the correct is that each exception be declared on its own in the
 throws clause of the method, and that your program handle them in the correct
 way.
 For example, 
\family typewriter
IllegalArgumentIOException
\family default
 occurs most times by a coding error and should never occur in production
 code.
 However, there may exist some exceptions that are less serious than others
 and can be ignored or handled locally, letting others to be passed along
 to the caller.
 Under situations that the handling is the same for all exceptions, there
 is no problem in catching them in a single 
\family typewriter
catch (Exception e)
\family default
 block.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, what's the correct way to handle the exception? The most common
 is call
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family typewriter
printStackTrace()
\family default
.
 This is a classic and BAD coding, because the stack trace is logged in
 the debug console (the same output of 
\family typewriter
Vm.debug()
\family default
), and thus the programmer will NOT know that the exception was thrown unless
 he exits the program and looks at the output file (note that in Eclipse
 or any other IDE the 
\family typewriter
printStackTrace()
\family default
 shows up in the console panel, not in the file).
 The ideal is that the exceptions are informed in real time, even if this
 can cause some bad impressions in your costumer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TotalCross has a method in the 
\family typewriter
MessageBox
\family default
 class that shows the exception in a dialog.
 Its format is shown in the previous example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

try
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

catch (Exception e)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

{
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	totalcross.ui.dialog.MessageBox.showException(e,true);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first parameter is the exception itself, and the second parameter indicates
 if
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family typewriter
printStackTrace()
\family default
 should be called.
 This method shows the stack trace on screen, along with the exception's
 class name and a description message, if any.
 You can change the title through the 
\family typewriter
MessageBox.showExceptionTitle
\family default
 member.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The use of exceptions is one of the most powerful features of Java, and
 can greatly simplify finding errors, if it is used correctly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TotalCross has checked and unchecked exceptions.
 The checked exceptions are 
\family typewriter
Exception
\family default
 subclasses and if they might happen in a code block, it must be surrounded
 by a try-catch.
 The unchecked exceptions are 
\family typewriter
RuntimeException
\family default
 subclasses and do not need to be treated.
 The first kind of exceptions are usually errors that occur in a program,
 whereas the second one are usually a programming bug.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

USER INTERFACE
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapterstar
Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following chapters will introduce you to the main aspects of user interface
 in TotalCross, including graphical interface controls and events support.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
User Interface styles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
List of types
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TotalCross has five look-and-feel types of user interfaces:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
WinCE
\family default
 – Defines a Windows CE user interface style.
 This is the default look-and-feel.
 People that use Microsoft Windows may feel better with it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
PalmOS
\family default
 – Defines a Palm OS user interface style.
 The controls are flat with round borders.
 Unlike the other styles, the default background color is white instead
 of blue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
Flat
\family default
 – Defines a FLAT user interface style that looks like the Pocket PC look-and-fe
el.
 It's basically the 
\family typewriter
WinCE
\family default
 style with flat controls.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
Vista
\family default
 – Defines a Windows Vista user interface style.
 It's like the Flat style with a shaded background.
 It looks better on 16bpp+.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
Android
\family default
 – Defines an Android user interface style.
 Its like the Vista but with round borders.
 Its almost identical to the controls used by the Android platform.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The style can be switched to by using 
\family typewriter
MainWindow.setUIStyle(int type)
\family default
, and it is platform-idenpendent (can be used in any device of any platform).

The decision of which user interface to use must be made in the main window's
 constructor.
 If nothing is changed, Windows CE with a blue background is used.
 Changing the user interface outside the main window's constructor can crash
 your application.
 If you try to change it more than once, a 
\family typewriter
RuntimeException
\family default
 will be thrown.
 The other possible values to 
\family typewriter

\begin_layout Section
Support for devices without pen
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The iPhone and Android platforms introduced the use of finger instead of
 pen (however, some new Android works better with pens than with finger).
 A finger is much less precise than a pen, thus an algorithm is used to
 locate the closest control.
 These platforms also introduced the concept of drag and flick: drag means
 that you placed your finger in the screen and moved it while pressed, and
 flick means that you suddenly lifted the finger, to continue the scroll
 even while your finger is up.
 The scroll then slows down until a complete stop or if you press the finger
 again.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TotalCross 1.3 added support for this, activated when you set the user interface
 style to Android or when making 
\family typewriter
Settings.fingerTouch = true
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following controls supports flicking: button menu, grid, list box, list
 container, multi edit, scroll container (and its subtypes), tabbed container,
 and tree.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When 
\family typewriter
fingerTouch
\family default
 is true, controls that can be flicked replace the scroll bar by a scroll
 position control, which only appears while the control is being scrolled
 or flicked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Font Support
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To keep the user interface consistent across different platforms, TotalCross
 applications uses its own font types instead of using the device's font
 type.
 The basic font type chosen for TotalCross is the Tahoma font, included
 on the SDK as the 
\family typewriter
TCFont.tcz file
\family default
.
 It contains fonts ranging from size 7 to 44, regular and bold.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The base size of the application's font is defined as 
\family typewriter
Font.NORMAL_SIZE
\family default
, which is a constant initialized at runtime based on the screen resolution.
 This way you may select another size by using a relative value, like 
\family typewriter
Font.NORMAL_SIZE+2
\family default
 (which is equal to 
\family typewriter
Font.BIG_SIZE
\family default
), and the font will be correctly scaled among different resolutions.
 The constants 
\family typewriter
Font.MIN_FONT_SIZE
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
Font.MAX_FONT_SIZE
\family default
 have the minimum and maximum font size, respectively.
 Their default values are 6 and 22, respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, 
\family typewriter
Font.TABSIZE
\family default
 is the number of spaces that will drawn when a tab character is found by
 the VM.
 You can define the number of spaces that will be drawn setting this field.
 It defaults to 3, but you can change it at any time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To create your own font files you may use the 
\family typewriter
FontGenerator
\family default
 (included in the 
\family typewriter
tc.jar
\family default
).
 It creates a compressed file with your own set of bitmap fonts, and supports
 anti-aliased fonts, which makes the font appear rounded and improves legibility.
 The created font must be based on the TrueType fonts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some usage examples (here we assume the 
\family typewriter
tc.jar
\family default
 is in the classpath):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Anti-aliased Arial font:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Anti-aliased Arial font, but including only the sizes 12 and 14.
 Reducing the final font file from 158kb to 16kb:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
java tc.tools.FontGenerator Arial /sizes:12,14 /aa /rename:TCFont
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Anti-aliased Arial font with Unicode characters up to 1279, but including
 only sizes 20, 24 and 28, and excluding bold fonts:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline

\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
To see if the font you created is installed on the target device, query
 its name after the creation.
 If the font is not found, its name is changed to match the default font.
 When the parameter 
\family typewriter
/rename:
\family default
 is used with 
\family typewriter
TCFont
\family default
, the default font is changed to the new created font.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Starting in version 1.3, we changed the font engine to generate better fonts.
 To keep compatibility with old programs, we have two font sets: TCFont
 and TCFontOld.
 By default, it will use the old font set.
 To use the new font set, you must add to your program: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
static {Settings.useNewFont = true;}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you don't set this, a warning will be issued in the output window when
 running the application on the desktop.
 Migrate to the new font as soon as possible.
 The default font name used is stored in 
\family typewriter
Font.DEFAULT
\family default
.

The TotalCross installation packages contains both fonts, thus, increasing

 size.
 If not on Android and

, the default font size will be increased by 15%.
\end_layout

getFont(boolean
\begin_inset space ~

boldStyle,

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

size) Gets the instance of the default font, with the given bold style and
 size.
 If 
\family typewriter
boldStyle == true
\family default
, a bold font is used; otherwise, a plain font is used.
 If you want a text bigger than the standard size, use 
\family typewriter
Font.NORMAL_SIZE+x
\family default
; or if you want a text smaller than the standard size, use 
\family typewriter
Font.NORMAL_SIZE-x
\family default
 in the parameter 
\family typewriter

\family default
.
 The size is adjusted to be in the range 
\family typewriter
Font.MIN_FONT_SIZE
\family default
 ...
 
\family typewriter
Font.MAX_FONT_SIZE
\family default
.
 That is, passing a value out of the bounds won't throw an exception, will

 use the maximum default size if the size passed is greater than it.

 BlackBerry supports the use of native system fonts, which are formed by
 the font family name preceded by a

\family default
 (e.g.: 
\family typewriter
$BBCasual
\family default
).
 You can also specify only 
\family typewriter

\family default
 for the font name, which means the default system font.
 
\family typewriter
Font.DEFAULT
\family default
 will be used in place of native fonts for all platforms that do not support
 them.
 This method can be used to check if the created font is in fact installed
 on the device.

\begin_layout Standard
The VM first calls the

MainWindow
\family default
 default constructor (in this case,

\family default
) and after that it enqueues a timer event, which will then call the 
\family typewriter

 method (inherited from the class 
\family typewriter

 You 
\emph on

\emph default
 initialize all the user interface in the

 Initializing the user interface on the constructor might crash the application,
 and some operations can only be performed after the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The

 the user closes the application or the programmer ends the application
 by using 
\family typewriter
exit()
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
exec()
\family default
, or even when the application is halted by an unhandled exception.
 However, under abnormal circumstances where a fatal error occurs, reseting
 the pda, the 
\family typewriter
onExit()
\family default
 method is not called.
 When this is called, all threads are already killed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
onStart()
\family default
: called when the application starts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter

\family default
: called when the user press the home key, or when a call is received, or
 when the screen turns off.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
onResume()
\family default
: called after the call ends or the screen is turned on again, or the program
 was exit softly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
onExit()
\family default
: called when the system decides that is time to finish the application.
 If the home key was pressed, this method is called when another application
 is launched.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the user press the home key and then forces the application to stop (by
 going to the Settings / Applications), then all Litebase tables may be
 corrupted (actually, no data is lost, but a 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

TableNotClosedException
\family default
 will be issued).
 So, it's a good thing to call 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline

LitebaseConnection.closeAll()
\family default
 in your Litebase instances in the 
\family typewriter
onPause()
\family default
 method and recover them in the

\begin_layout Section
Making UI adjustments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The constants described above have one important feature: a variable or
 a number can be used to increment/decrement the result value.
 Examples: 
\family typewriter
CENTER+2
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
BOTTOM-5
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
PREFERRED+4
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
FILL+2
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
BEFORE-5
\family default
.
 This value cannot be higher than 5, otherwise your interface will not be
 properly shown in other resolutions.
 Using something like 
\family typewriter
LEFT+10
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
BOTTOM-15
\family default
 is as bad as using absolute values.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, these values suffer a problem: a pixel's size may vary depending
 on the screen's density (also known as DPI).
 So, 4 may be good at a 240x320 screen, but too small in a 600x1024 tablet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To bypass these limitations, we introduced a way to compute that adjustment
 based on the current's font size instead of a fixed pixel value.
 To enable it, you must set the following property at the application's
 static initializer:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family typewriter
Settings.uiAdjustmentsBasedOnFontHeight = true;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After doing this, the adjustment you make will be a percentage of the font's
 height.
 So, 
\family typewriter
AFTER+50
\family default
 is 
\family typewriter
AFTER+
\family default
(50% of font's height), 
\family typewriter
PREFERRED+20
\family default
 is 
\family typewriter
PREFERRED+(
\family default
20% of font's height), and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, this feature is not supported by all controls.
 To disable this feature for a particular control the property 
\family typewriter
uiAdjustmentsBasedOnFontHeightIsSupported
\family default
 is set to 
\family typewriter
false
\family default
 in the class constructor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The controls can be traversed using the 5-way navigation present on most
 PDAs and Smartphones.

 on pen devices by setting the property 
\family typewriter
Settings.keyboardFocusTraversable
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
.
 Controls are traversed according to the order of elements in the field
 
\family typewriter
Container.tabOrder
\family default
.
 The controls are added to the vector in the order as they are added to
 the container.
 This may not be optimal; you may assign a new order by adding the controls
 to the vector:
\end_layout

The last four methods are useful when you’re adding controls that do not
 need to have any of its characteristics (like font or border) changed.
 Changing the control's characteristics 
\emph on
after
\emph default
 those methods will give you unpredictable results.
 This happens because the control does not reposition/resize itself when
 you change its characteristics (just as an example, suppose that the default
 font has 11 in height, and you add the control; then you change the font
 to one with height 22; the control will not be resized and you'll see only
 half of the text).

Events
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Events represent all activity that goes on between the user and the application.
 When the user interacts with a program, the VM creates an event representing
 the action and communicates these actions to the programs using events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter is organized into the following sections to provide a quick
 start on event handling in TotalCross:
\end_layout

If you're new to TotalCross and want to get things started quickly, skip
 the Delegation Event Model in section two – “Handling Events”.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you're familiar with TotalCross and wants to know more about events,
 make sure you understand both event-handling models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Control Events
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two basic types of events: pen events and key events.
 These events are handled by the window, which creates a new event of the
 proper type (pen event or key event) and forwards it to the target control.
 These events are handled by the control, which may convert them to other
 events, defined on the class 
\family typewriter
ControlEvent
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Below we can see how each event defined on 
\family typewriter
ControlEvent
\family default
 is handled by each control:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
\series medium
PRESSED
\family default
\series default
 this event is posted by controls when they receive a 
\family typewriter
PEN_DOWN
\family default
 (like check, radio, tab panel), and a 
\family typewriter
PEN_UP
\family default
 (button, list box, push button group, scrollBar) or even a 
\family typewriter
WINDOW_CLOSED
\family default
 (comboBox).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\series medium
and
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\family typewriter
FOCUS_OUT
\family default
\series default
 posted by the window when a control different from the current one is clicked.
 The 
\family typewriter
FOCUS_OUT
\family default
 is first posted to the old control, and the event 
\family typewriter
FOCUS_IN
\family default
 is then posted to the new control.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
\series medium
TIMER
\family default
\series default
 this is a special event that is posted to the control that has a timer
 assigned to it; it is called when the timer countdown has reached zero.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\family typewriter
\series medium
WINDOW_CLOSED
\family default
\series default
 posted by the unpop method to notify all controls that a window has been
 closed.
 Some controls, like combo box, has a pop list assigned to it; when the
 pop list issues a 
\family typewriter
WINDOW_CLOSED
\family default
 event, the combo box receives it and converts to a 
\family typewriter
PRESSED
\family default
 event.
\end_layout

Unlike the other controls, the grid control has its own set of event types
 defined on the grid event class:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TotalCross implements two event-handling models.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Inheritance Event Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar to the Java 1.0 event model, this approach requires you to subclass
 UI components and override the event handling method – 
\family typewriter
onEvent(Event e)
\family default
 – in order to catch and process UI events.
 When a control posts an event (using the 
\family typewriter
postEvent()
\family default
 method) it is propagated sequentially up the UI hierarchy until it is either
 consumed, or the root of the hierarchy is reached.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we have a button inside a tab panel in a window, and this button receives
 an event, the event is propagated up the hierarchy:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
After handling the event, you can break the event propagation by setting
 the 
\family typewriter
Event.consumed
\family default
 field to 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's a simple example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false

\begin_layout Plain Layout

public class MyProgram extends MainWindow
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		add(pushB = new Button("Push me

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

				if (event.target == pushB)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

					// handle pushB being pressed
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

			break;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

		}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Box Shadowbox

hor_pos "c"
has_inner_box 1
inner_pos "t"
use_parbox 0
use_makebox 0
width "100col%"
special "none"
height "1in"
height_special "totalheight"
status open

\begin_layout Itemize
Disabled controls can only post 
\family typewriter
TIMER
\family default
 events.
 The method 
\family typewriter
postEvent()
\family default
 returns immediately if the control is not enabled and the type of the event
 received is not 
\family typewriter
TIMER
\family default
.
 The only exception to this occurs on fingertouch devices, to allow the
 flick stop or start when a 
\family typewriter
PEN_DOWN
\family default
 occurs in a disabled control.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The event propagation stops if the control is moved to another container.
 For example, when you pop up the keyboard, the target edit is removed from
 its parent and added to the keyboard window; at this time, the event propagatio
n (of the key event) stops.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\family typewriter
MainWindow
\family default
 does not receive an event posted by a control in a popup window.
 The only exception for this is the 
\family typewriter
WINDOW_CLOSED
\family default
, which is posted to the window that popped it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A control that is not added to a container (or any parent of its container
 is not added to a window) will never receive events nor be repainted.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Small programs can handle the events by implementing the 
\family typewriter
onEvent()
\family default
 method in the 
\family typewriter
MainWindow
\family default
 class, but it can become confusing if the program gets bigger.
 An alternative is to create classes that extend 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
 and swap them on the 
\family typewriter
MainWindow
\family default
 as the user navigates through the program.
 Each class implementing the 
\family typewriter
onEvent()
\family default
 method will have to handle its own events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Delegation Event Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar to the event model introduced by Java 1.1, this approach solves some
 limitations of the Inheritance Event Model, which are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To be able to handle events, a class must subclass 
\family typewriter
Control
\family default
 and implement the 
\family typewriter
onEvent()
\family default
 method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Since all event types are filtered through the 
\family typewriter
onEvent()
\family default
 method, the method is executed whenever the control receives an event,
 regardless of its type.
 If a particular event type is ignored by the whole program, it will never
 be handled and consumed.
 Instead, it will keep going up on the hierarchy until it reaches the root,
 wasting resources in the process.
 The only way to avoid it – handling all event types, consuming events that
 are no handled anywhere on the program as soon as they are received – is
 discouraged and can lead to complex and error-prone code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Events are supposed to be handled only by the control that receives the
 event.
 Handling events received by a control in another class is a hard task.
 An example is the tooltip control, which works by handling the pen events
 received by the control it refers to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this model, an event is propagated from a “source” object to a “listener”
 object by invoking a method on the listener.
 and passing in the instance of the event subclass, which defines the event
 type generated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A listener is an object that implements a specific 
\family typewriter
EventListener
\family default
 interface.
 An 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

EventListener
\family default
 interface defines one or more methods which are to be invoked by the event
 source in response to each specific event type handled by the interface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An event source is an object which originates events.
 The source defines the set of events it emits by providing a set of 
\family typewriter
add<EventType>Listener(<EventType>Listener)
\family default
 methods which are used to register specific listeners for those events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's the same example, using an 
\family typewriter
EventListener()
\family default
 instead of overriding 
\family typewriter
onEvent()
\family default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings

Creating listeners using the new

, as indicated above, makes your program bigger and should be used with
 care.

\begin_layout Section
The Event class
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's now look at the details of each 
\family typewriter
Event
\family default
 class.
 As already described, TotalCross has four classes in the 
\family typewriter
totalcross.ui
\family default
 package: 
\family typewriter
ControlEvent
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
PenEvent
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
KeyEvent
\family default
 and their parent class, 
\family typewriter
Event
\family default
, which provides some useful members:
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

type this is the event number, used to detect which event was posted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
Object
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

target this one informs who is receiving the event (E.g.: the VM posts a 
\family typewriter
PenEvent.PEN_DOWN
\family default
 to a control) or who is posting it (E.g.: the control posts an 
\family typewriter
ControlEvent.PRESSED
\family default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

timeStamp contains the time stamp at which the event was created.

height_special "totalheight"
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Be careful with the time stamp.
 There is no way to convert it to the current 
\family typewriter
hh:mm:ss:millis
\family default
.
 It is just useful for comparison purposes; or to compute the time elapsed
 since the last event occurred.
 You can use it to simulate a double-click, by checking the elapsed time
 between two clicks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To keep memory usage low, some VM routines reuse 
\family typewriter
PenEvent

s objects; so, if you just save a reference to the object instead of the
 time stamp itself, you may get unexpected results.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
Event
\family default
 class also has a static method called 
\family typewriter
getNextAvailableEventId()
\family default
.
 This method is used to avoid conflicts when your application or library
 creates a new 
\family typewriter
Event
\family default
 type.
 It is discussed in more details in PART V of this manual.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
PenEvent
\family default
 has three members: 
\family typewriter
x
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
y
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
modifiers
\family default
.
 The coordinates are stored in the 
\family typewriter
x
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
y
\family default
; 
\family typewriter
modifiers
\family default
 is not used on the PalmOS platform, only on the other platforms.
 The last member is the state of the modifier keys when the event occured.
 This is an 
\family typewriter
OR
\family default
'ed combination of the modifiers present in the 
\family typewriter
DeviceKeys
\family default
 interface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
KeyEvent
\family default
 has also two members: 
\family typewriter
key
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
modifiers
\family default
.
 
\family typewriter
key
\family default
 can assume values from the ASCII table and special ones defined in the
 t
\family typewriter
otalcross.sys.Specialkeys
\family default
 interface.
 
\family typewriter
modifiers
\family default
 is used on all platforms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of the keys defined in 
\family typewriter
totalcross.sys.SpecialKeys
\family default
 need a special code to be manipulated: they are not handled by the application
 unless the app requests it.
 For example, the 
\family typewriter
totalcross.sys.SpecialKeys.UP
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
totalcross.sys.SpecialKeys.DOWN
\family default
 are automatically sent to the application's event queue, but the 
\family typewriter
SpecialKeys.KEYBOARD_*
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
SpecialKeys.HARD*
\family default
, not.
 To be able to intercept these keys, you must use the method 
\family typewriter
Vm.
 interceptSpecialKeys(mask)
\family default
.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The

SpecialKeys
\family default
 interface does not have all possible keys mapped.
 If you have a particular device, you can learn the code of a key by creating
 a test application and calling 
\family typewriter
Vm.showKeyCodes(boolean on)
\family default
.
 When this mode is on, each time a key is pressed, the VM shows an alert
 with the code.
 Then use this key code in the 
\family typewriter
Vm.interceptSpecialKeys()
\family default
.

\begin_layout Chapter
Basic Controls
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter we will learn the details of all basic controls in the package
 
\family typewriter
totalcross.ui
\family default
: button, edit, label, check, radio, radio group controller, combo box,
 list box, multi edit, grid, and tooltip.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each control can have its font, foreground/background colors and state (enabled/
disabled) set.
 Their look depends on the look-and-feel set on the 
\family typewriter
MainWindow
\family default
 constructor (
\family typewriter
WinCE
\family default
 is the default).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each control we’ll see its characteristics, how to create them with
 the provided constructors, and how to handle their events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can see most of the user interface controls available in TotalCross
 looking at the UIGadgets and AndroidUI samples.

\begin_layout Section
Button
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Buttons are the most used types of controls.
 They are used to invoke an action or to confirm something, like [ok] or
 [cancel].
 Here are some characteristics of TotalCross buttons:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It supports multi-lined text, mixed with images.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It has five border styles:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
BORDER_3D_GRADIENT_HORIZONTAL_GRADIENT
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
A button can be made sticky by setting the 
\family typewriter
isSticky
\family default
 field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If you create an image button and add a text using the 
\family typewriter
setText()
\family default
 method, both of them will appear on the control.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the button has an image, you can change the image that is displayed while
 the button is pressed by changing the pressedImage field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If you create an image for the button, make sure that its a PNG with alpha-chann
el (transparency).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can make a button fire more than one event while it is pressed changing
 the field 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

autoRepeat
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The methods 
\family typewriter
setImage()
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
setText()
\family default
 don't resize the button to fit the image.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\family typewriter
clear()
\family default
 method is ignored by the 
\family typewriter
Button
\family default
 class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The class 
\family typewriter
Button
\family default
 has the static field 
\family typewriter
commonGap
\family default
.
 It defines the internal gap between the button content and its borders.
 Changing this value affects all buttons created after the new value was
 set – it does not affect buttons previously created.
 A good practice is to set the field for the desired value before you create
 the buttons (at the beginning of 
\family typewriter
initUI()
\family default
 for instance) and reset it back to zero after you finish (at the end of
 
\family typewriter
initUI()
\family default

\begin_layout Section
Edit
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Edit is a control used to get text input when the user types using the keyboard
 or the grafitti area.
 It allows you to select text and cut/copy/paste it.
 Here are some other features:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There are two constructors: the default (with no arguments) that creates
 an edit with no constraints, and one constructor that receives a mask string.
 The mask is used, primarily, to compute the preferred width.
 If the mask is "", the width will be set to 
\family typewriter
FILL
\family default
.
 To be able to use the mask to format the input, you must call the 
\family typewriter
setMode()
\family default
 method passing 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
 to the second argument.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can limit the maximum length of characters that can be entered, by using
 the 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

setMaxLength()
\family default
 method.
 If the user tries to enter text above the limit, a beep is sounded and
 the text is ignored.
 If you set a text greater than the maximum length, it will be truncated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can also set the valid characters that can be entered by using the 
\family typewriter
setValidChars()
\family default
 method.
 There are some predefined character sets that can be localized if necessary:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
numbersSet = "0123456789"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
currencyCharsSet = "0123456789.+-"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
dateSet = numbersSet + Settings.dateSeparator
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Those character sets are used in the 
\family typewriter
setMode()
\family default
 method that receives one of the following constants:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
NORMAL
\family default
: in this mode any character can be entered.
 For Palm OS only, when pressing the abc/123 keys the 
\family typewriter
totalcross.ui.KeyboardBox
\family default
 is popped up; on all other platforms, the default input method is used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
DATE
\family default
: this mode uses the 
\family typewriter
dateSet()
\family default
 and the 
\family typewriter
totalcross.ui.CalendarBox()
\family default
 is the one popped up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
CURRENCY
\family default
: the 
\family typewriter
currencyCharsSet
\family default
 is used and the 
\family typewriter
totalcross.ui.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

CalculatorBox
\family default
 is the one popped up.
 You can change the calculator to a numeric box for a specific edit by making
 
\family typewriter
setKeyboard(Edit.KBD_TIME)
\family default
 or for all edits of the application, by doing 
\family typewriter
Edit.useNumericBoxInsteadOfCalculator = true
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
PASSWORD
\family default
: any character can be entered and the 
\family typewriter
totalcross.ui.Keyboard
\family default
 is the one popped up.
 Only the last character typed is displayed in this mode, all the others
 are replaced by an asterisk (*).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
PASSWORD_ALL
\family default
: same of 
\family typewriter
PASSWORD
\family default
 except that all characters are replaced by an asterisk (*), including the
 last one.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
There's another 
\family typewriter
setMode()
\family default
 method that, besides the constants listed above, also receives a boolean
 to make the edit use a mask on the input text instead of popping a window.
 It should be used with the constants 
\family typewriter
DATE
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
CURRENCY
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To retrieve the text shown as is, use 
\family typewriter
getText()
\family default
.
 If a mask is used, you can return the text without the mask using 
\family typewriter
getTextWithoutMask()
\family default
.
 To set the text to another one, call 
\family typewriter
setText()
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To return the length of a text without having to call 
\family typewriter
getText()
\family default
, you can call 
\family typewriter
getLength()
\family default
.
 To apply trimming in the string and return its length, call 
\family typewriter
getTrimmedLength()
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The method 
\family typewriter
setDecimalPlaces()
\family default
 can be used with 
\family typewriter
setMode(CURRENCY, true)
\family default
 to set the number of decimal places the mask will use.
 The default value is 2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The edit can be set as read-only using the method 
\family typewriter
setEditable()
\family default
 and setting it to 
\family typewriter
false
\family default
.
 You can also set the field 
\family typewriter
hasCursorWhenNotEditable
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
false
\family default
 to make the blinking cursor not appear when this edit is not editable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There's a public member named 
\family typewriter
overwrite
\family default
 which, if set to 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
, turns off insert mode (ie, characters will be replaced if written over).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The member 
\family typewriter
alignment
\family default
, which can be set to 
\family typewriter
LEFT
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
RIGHT
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
CENTER
\family default
, lets you control the alignment of the text inside the edit after the control
 loses the focus.
 The text is always left-aligned when it has the focus.
 The only exception is when mode is set to CURRENCY, when the numbers will
 be typed using right-align.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can invoke the default popup keyboard for the edit using the 
\family typewriter
popupKCC()
\family default
 method (KCC = Keyboard, Calculator and Calendar).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You may specify which keyboard will be popped up, overriding the default
 behavior, using the 
\family typewriter
setKeyboard()
\family default
 method, passing the constants 
\family typewriter
KBD_NONE
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
KBD_DEFAULT
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
KBD_ KEYBOARD
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
KBD_CALCULATOR
\family default
, or 
\family typewriter
KBD_CALENDAR
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You may force all characters entered to be automatically converted to upper
 or to lower case by setting the field 
\family typewriter
capitalise
\family default
 with the constants 
\family typewriter
ALL_UPPER
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
ALL_LOWER
\family default
; the constant 
\family typewriter
ALL_NORMAL
\family default
 disables this feature.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The field 
\family typewriter
autoSelect
\family default
 makes the edit automatically select the text when it receives the focus.
 This is always true for penless devices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The method 
\family typewriter
setCursorPos(start, end)
\family default
 can be used to set the selected text of the edit (
\family typewriter
if start != end
\family default
).
 It can be used to set the cursor position, if 
\family typewriter
start
\family default
 equals 
\family typewriter
end
\family default
.
 
\family typewriter
start
\family default
 must be less or equal to 
\family typewriter
end
\family default
, and both must be 
\family typewriter
>= 0
\family default
.
 It can also be used to clear the selected text, calling 
\family typewriter
setCursorPos(-1,0)
\family default
.
 Note: if you're setting the cursor position before the edit is drawn for
 the first time, the edit will not be scrolled if the end position goes
 beyond the limits.
 Important! No bound checking is made.
 Be sure to not call this method with invalid positions!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The method 
\family typewriter
getCursorPos()
\family default
 returns an integer array 
\family typewriter
(int[])
\family default
 with the start (array index 0) and end (array index 1) positions of the
 cursor.
 It can be used to find the selected text, which will be the 
\family typewriter
substring(start, end)
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When a selection is made or when the user clicks and holds an edit at the
 same point, a popup menu is shown so user can cut/copy/paste.
 You can disable this feature by calling 
\family typewriter
Edit.clipboardDelay = -1
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In the Android user interface style, you can change the color of the edit
 that have focus using the 
\family typewriter
focusColor
\family default
 field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can remap a key to be used in the edit (For example, remap F1 to 1,
 F2 to 2, etc) by calling the 
\family typewriter
mapKeys()
\family default
 method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\family typewriter
clear()
\family default
 method uses 
\family typewriter
clearValueStr
\family default
 to set the text of the edit.

\begin_layout Standard
The Edit control posts a 
\family typewriter
ControlEvent.PRESSED
\family default
 event when the text changes.
 You may also want to intercept the event 
\family typewriter
ControlEvent.FOCUS_OUT
\family default
 to validate the edit’s text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Label
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This control is used to display static text, or a marquee.
 The label in TotalCross can also display multiple lines of text, separated
 by the character 
\family typewriter

\backslash
n
\family default
.
 Here are some other features:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Label has three constructors: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
Label() Creates an empty label, using 
\family typewriter
FILL
\family default
 as the preferred width.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
Label(String
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

text) Creates a label displaying the given text (that may be changed at
 runtime) using left alignment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
Label(String
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

text,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

align) Like the above, but you can also set the horizontal alignment using
 one of the constants 
\family typewriter
LEFT
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
CENTER
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
RIGHT
\family default
, or 
\family typewriter
FILL
\family default
 (justified).
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The three align constants are inherited from the 
\family typewriter
totalcross.ui.Control
\family default
 class, where they are used in the 
\family typewriter
setRect()
\family default
 method.
 Furthermore, you can use new
\family typewriter
 Label(“my text”, Label.CENTER)
\family default
 or new 
\family typewriter
Label(“my text”, CENTER)
\family default
; it will work in the same way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The vertical alignment can be controlled using the 
\family typewriter
vAlign
\family default
 field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The text is used to compute the preferred size.
 If you pass an empty string as text, the preferred width will be 
\family typewriter
FILL
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can set/change the label's text alignment accessing the public member
 align.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can call the 
\family typewriter
set3d()
\family default
 method to make the label have a 3d look, by drawing it with the foreground
 color and with a color a little brighter than the background color.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Labels can look inverted, by swapping the background and the foreground
 colors.
 To do this, use the 
\family typewriter
setInvert()
\family default
 method.
 By calling it twice you can make the text blink.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The text can be highlighted using the 
\family typewriter
setHighlighted()
\family default
 method.
 The highlight color can be set using 
\family typewriter
setHighlightedColor()
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Labels can’t be inverted and 3d at the same time.
 Calling 
\family typewriter
set3d()
\family default
 cancels 
\family typewriter
setInverted()
\family default
 and vice-versa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the label is a multi-line one, you can use the method 
\family typewriter
scroll(boolean down)
\family default
 to make it scroll up and down, and also the 
\family typewriter
canScroll(boolean down)
\family default
 method to peek if it can be scrolled in the desired direction.
 To see a good usage example of this feature, see the 
\family typewriter
totalcross.ui.dialog.MessageBox
\family default
 class.
 By default, the scroll is done a page at a time; to scroll a line at a
 time, change the 
\family typewriter
pageScroll
\family default
 field to 
\family typewriter
false
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
By default, the 
\family typewriter
clear()
\family default
 method does not affect the label's text.
 If you really want to clear it, you must explicitly set 
\family typewriter
clearValueStr()
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\family typewriter
setText()
\family default
 method, used to change the label’s text, does not change the control’s
 bounds.
 You must be sure that the label has enough size to hold the text otherwise
 it will be clipped.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
By default, this class does not do automatic parses the text, because this
 is a slow operation.
 You may change this behaviour by using the 
\family typewriter
autoSplit()
\family default
 field, or calling the split method directly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The method 
\family typewriter
runMarquee(int delay, int loopCount, int step)
\family default
 shows the label as a horizontal marquee.
 The text must have a single line (if it has more than one line, only the
 first line is shown).
 To stop the marquee, just call 
\family typewriter
setText()
\family default
.
 When a window covers the marquee, it is halted, and resumed when the window
 is closed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If you have problems with labels when a rotation occurs, check the 
\family typewriter
preferredWidthText
\family default
 field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can add a border to the label by changing the 
\family typewriter
borderColor
\family default
 field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The background can be changed from solid to a shade by using the 
\family typewriter
backgroundType
\family default
 field.
\end_layout

Check
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Check is a control that has a rectangle with a check inside and a text at
 right, and is used for items that have an on/off state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It has only one constructor:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
Check(String
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

text) Creates a check control displaying the given text.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The check's text is right justified in the control's width by default.
 You may change this behavior by setting the field 
\family typewriter
leftJustify
\family default
 to true, this will make the text to be left justified in the control's
 width.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To change the check's color, which defaults to the foreground color, use
 the 
\family typewriter
checkColor
\family default
 field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The method 
\family typewriter
isChecked()
\family default
 returns the current checked state of the control.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You may use 
\family typewriter
setChecked(boolean checked)
\family default
 to change its state to checked or unchecked.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The method 
\family typewriter
setText()
\family default
 can be used to change the displayed text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The method 
\family typewriter
clear()
\family default
 uses the field 
\family typewriter
clearValueInt
\family default
 to set the check state.
 It sets the control as checked only if 
\family typewriter
clearValueInt
\family default

\begin_layout Section
Radio and RadioGroupController
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Radio is a control that allows the user to choose one of a predefined set
 of options.
 They are usually grouped together, and when the user selects one of them,
 any previously selected radio in the same group becomes deselected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In TotalCross, radio controls are grouped together using the radio group
 controller.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It has two constructors:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
Radio(String
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

text) Creates a radio control displaying the given text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
Radio(String
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

text,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

RadioGroupController
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

radioGroup) Creates a radio control displaying the given text and attached
 to the given radio group.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The radio group controller is not a control, therefore you cannot add it
 to a container and it does not post events.
 It just provides useful methods to handle groups of radio controls, like:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
getSelectedIndex() returns the index of the selected radio.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
setSelectedIndex(int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

index) to select a radio by its index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
getSelectedItem() returns the radio selected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
setSelectedItem(int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

index) selects a given radio group controller.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
These indices are based in the order that the radios are added to the container.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You may use the 
\family typewriter
getRadioGroupController()
\family default
 method to make it easier to parse the events.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The check's text is right justified in the control's width by default.
 You may change this behavior by setting the field 
\family typewriter
leftJustify
\family default
 to true, this will make the text to be left justified in the control's
 width.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To change the check's color, which defaults to the foreground color, use
 the 
\family typewriter
checkColor
\family default
 field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\family typewriter
clear()
\family default
 method selects the given radio if its 
\family typewriter
clearValueInt
\family default
 is 1.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
ComboBox
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The combo box is a very useful control to display a list of items where
 only one can be selected.
 It consists of a text with a button and a combo box drop down control that
 is popped up when the button is pressed.
 The popped up list is closed when one of its items is selected or the control
 loses the focus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It has four constructors, but we'll only detail the three more interesting
 ones:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
ComboBox() Creates an empty combo box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
ComboBox(ListBox
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

userListBox) Creates a combo box with a combo box drop down containing the
 given list box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
ComboBox(Object[]
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

items) creates a combo box with the given items.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Using the Palm OS UI style, the combo box drop down control covers the combo
 box control, otherwise it is placed above or below the combo box, without
 covering it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The combo box drop down height depends on the control's position: it will
 open in the direction that has the most space left (above or below).
 If you set the public member 
\family typewriter
fullHeight
\family default
 to true, then it will have the same height as the screen, maximizing the
 number of items displayed.
 In the same way, the 
\family typewriter
fullWidth
\family default
 will set the width to the screen's one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\family typewriter
clear()
\family default
 method selects the index using the 
\family typewriter
clearValueInt
\family default
 value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The color used in the 
\family typewriter
setBackground()
\family default
 method will be used in the arrow button only.
 The background color of the combo box text and combo box drop down will
 be a lighter version of the given color.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can change the combo box's scroll bar default width.
 To do so, you must use the static field 
\family typewriter
Button.commonGap
\family default
.
 Increasing its value will also increase the width of the arrow button and
 the scrollbar.
 Remember to reset the 
\family typewriter
Button.commonGap
\family default
 value to 0 after the combo box creation, otherwise it will keep affecting
 all combo box and buttons created after.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You may append new items to your combo box using the method 
\family typewriter
add()
\family default
, which has three useful implementations:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
add(Object
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

item) Adds an object to the ComboBox.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
add(Object[]
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

items) Adds an array of objects to the combo box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
add(Object[]
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

items,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

startAt,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

size) Adds a subarray of objects to the combo box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Box Shadowbox

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
You may insert new items at a desired position using 
\family typewriter
insert(Object item, int index)
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The method 
\family typewriter
setItemAt(int i, Object s)
\family default
 replaces the object at the given index by the given object.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Use 
\family typewriter
size()
\family default
 to retrieve the number of items available on the combo box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The method 
\family typewriter
getItemAt(int i)
\family default
 returns the object at the selected index; the reverse operation can be
 done with 
\family typewriter
indexOf(Object name)
\family default
, which retrieves the index of a specific object.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Use 
\family typewriter
getSelectedIndex()
\family default
 to get the index of the selected item, or 
\family typewriter
getSelectedItem()
\family default
 to retrieve the selected object directly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You may select an item by its index with 
\family typewriter
setSelectedIndex(int i)
\family default
 or by its content with 
\family typewriter
setSelectedItem(Object name)
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\family typewriter
selectLast()
\family default
 method selects the last item added to the combo box, doing a scroll if
 needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To remove items from a combo box, you may use one of the following three
 methods:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
remove(int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

itemIndex) Removes an object from the combo box by its index.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
remove(Object
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

item) Removes the given object from the combo box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
removeAll() Empties the combo box.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The combo box items can be sorted using the method 
\family typewriter
qsort()
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
It is possible to make a list box scroll horizontally (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand nameref
reference "sec:ListBox"

\end_inset

).
 To be able to scroll the list box associated with this combo box, just
 call the method 
\family typewriter
enableHorizontalScroll()
\family default
.
\end_layout

Be careful when setting the items with an object array.
 The array is assigned as is, no copy is made.
 So, if you use the same array in another control and an item inside the
 array is changed, this change will reflect in both controls.
 However, if you add a new item, a new array is created to store the added
 item and the program works correctly.
 The best practice is to have one array for each list box control.
 To copy the contents of an object array to a new one, you can use 
\family typewriter
totalcross.sys.Vm.arrayCopy()
\family default
.
 If you're dealing specifically with string arrays, you may instead use
 
\family typewriter

MultiEdit
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The multi edit is basically an edit with support for multiple lines, so
 their usage is pretty similar and, unless noted otherwise, the same methods
 listed for edit are available for multi edit.
 A static vertical scrollbar is added, but it is disabled/enabled as needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The method

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
With 
\family typewriter
setScrollbarsAlwaysVisible(boolean asNeeded)
\family default
 you can change the multi edit's scrollbar behavior.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
By default, a dotted line is shown under each text row.
 You can change this behavior with the boolean field 
\family typewriter

	String s = "James Robert Baker (1946-1997) was an American author of sharply
 satirical, predominantly gay-themed transgressional fiction.
 A native Californian, his work is set almost entirely in Southern California.
 After graduating from UCLA, he began his career as a screenwriter, but
 became disillusioned and started writing novels instead.
 Though he garnered fame for his books Fuel-Injected Dreams and Boy Wonder,
 after the controversy surrounding publication of his novel, Tim And Pete,
 he faced increasing difficulty having his work published.
 According to his life partner, this was a contributing factor in his suicide.
 Baker's work has achieved cult status in the years since his death, and
 two additional novels have been posthumously published.
 First-edition copies of his earlier works have become collector's items.
 One of his novels was filmed (though it was not a financial success) and
 two others have been optioned for the movies, though they have not been
 produced.";

Grid
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The grid control is used to display tabulated data, which is represented
 as a string matrix (each row is a string array).
 Optionally, you may add an extra column of check boxes on the left side
 of the grid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the TotalCross' grid control usage is pretty simple and straightforward
, it is the most customizable control and it uses its own set of events
 defined in 
\family typewriter
GridEvents
\family default
 (unlike the other controls that use only 
\family typewriter
ControlEvents
\family default
).
 That means you'll be able to start using grids within a couple of minutes,
 but it will take some time to learn to use all its features:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Horizontal scrolling in case the columns widths are greater than the screen
 width.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Vertical scrollbar to scroll up and down the information on the grid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An easy to use interface for adding/removing information to the grid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Optional check column which is a column that is clickable, marking an specific
 line as checked/ unchecked; this is usefull if you want the user to be
 able to select multiple lines displayed on the grid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Columns can be resized so that the user can see all the information displayed
 in a given column.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Style configuration, which you can set the color of captions boxes all the
 way through the stripes colors and vertical line types.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\family typewriter
GridEvent
\family default
 class contains the events generated by the grid.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A column may be marked as editable.
 In this case, an edit will be placed in the currently focused cell.
 A column can also have choices (combo box).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The columns can be sorted by clicking in the title.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the text is bigger than the size of the column, you can click and hold
 in the cell to display a tooltip with the full text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can customize cell back and fore colors, enabled state and choices by
 using the

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
This class implements a message box that shows a spinner at the left of
 the text.
 You can set the spinner color and type before constructing the progress
 box (usually you do this in your application's constructor, and not for
 each progress bar created).

\begin_layout Chapter
The Window class
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you already know, a TotalCross program with user interface consists of
 one and only one main window (a class that directly or indirecly extends
 
\family typewriter
MainWindow
\family default
).
 This main window can pop up a window, and this new window can pop up another
 one, and so on.
 Windows in TotalCross are always modal, therefore, only the last popped
 up window can receive events and you cannot switch from the topmost Window
 to the previous without closing the topmost one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the 
\family typewriter
Window
\family default
 class extends 
\family typewriter
Control
\family default
, you can't add a 
\family typewriter
Window
\family default
 to a 
\family typewriter
Container
\family default
.
 Doing this results in a 
\family typewriter
RuntimeException
\family default
.
 To show a window, you must use the method 
\family typewriter
popup()
\family default
 or the method 
\family typewriter
popupNonBlocking()
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some other features of the 
\family typewriter
Window
\family default
 class:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Windows can have a title that can be set by the method 
\family typewriter
setTitle()
\family default
 or passed to the constructor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The window border can be selected from one of the multiple styles shown
 below, by using the 
\family typewriter
setBorderStyle()
\family default
 method or passing the desired style to the 
\family typewriter
Window
\family default
 constructor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There are two constructors: the default one, that creates a window with
 no title and no border, and one constructor with both title and border
 parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Windows can be moved around the screen by dragging the window’s title.
 If the window has no title, it can’t be moved.
 You can make a titled window unmovable by calling the 
\family typewriter
makeUnmovable()
\family default
 method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The title font can be changed using the 
\family typewriter
setTitleFont()
\family default
 method.
 By default, the font is the one used by the main window, with bold style.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Only one control can hold the focus at a time.
 To change focus to another control, use the 
\family typewriter
setFocus()
\family default
 method (this can also be done through the 
\family typewriter
requestFocus()
\family default
 method in the 
\family typewriter
totalcross.ui.Control
\family default
 class).
 The 
\family typewriter
getFocus()
\family default
 method returns the control that currently owns the focus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The rectangle area excluding the border and the title is defined as the
 client rectangle.
 You can get it with the 
\family typewriter
getClientRect()
\family default
 method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A window can be popped up by calling the 
\family typewriter
popupNonBlocking()
\family default
 method and can be unpopped by calling the 
\family typewriter
unpop()
\family default
 method.
 The popup process saves the area behind the window that is being popped
 up and the unpop process restores that area.
 The 
\family typewriter
unpop()
\family default
 method posts a 
\family typewriter
ControlEvent.WINDOW_CLOSED
\family default
 event to the caller window.
 The 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

popupNonBlocking()
\family default
 method can be called like 
\family typewriter
this.popupNonBlocking()
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A window can also be popped up by calling the 
\family typewriter
popup()
\family default
 method, and be unpopped by the same 
\family typewriter
unpop() 
\family default
method described above.
 The big difference is that in 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

popupNonBlocking()
\family default
, the program execution continues to the next line, while in 
\family typewriter
popup()
\family default
, the program execution is halted and only continues when the popped up
 window is dismissed.
 
\family typewriter
Menu
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
MessageBox
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
ComboBox
\family default
, and 
\family typewriter
ComboBoxDropDown
\family default
 are popped up using 
\family typewriter
popupNonBlocking()
\family default
, because execution does not need to be halted.
 
\family typewriter
InputDialog
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
Calendar
\family default
, and 
\family typewriter
Calculator
\family default
 are usually popped up using 
\family typewriter
popup()
\family default
 because the user may want to get the result of the dialog in an easy way.

You can't use 
\family typewriter
popup()
\family default
 to popup alternating windows that call each other recursively.
 For example, suppose that from 
\family typewriter
win1
\family default
 you call 
\family typewriter
win2.popup()
\family default
, then at 
\family typewriter
win2
\family default
 you call 
\family typewriter
unpop()
\family default
 and then 
\family typewriter
win1.popup()
\family default
.
 Then, from 
\family typewriter
win1
\family default
 you do 
\family typewriter
unpop()
\family default
 again and 
\family typewriter
win2.popup()
\family default
, and so on.
 This will lead to an 
\family typewriter

 To fix this, just replace the popup by 
\family typewriter
popupNonBlocking()
\family default
.

\begin_layout Itemize
The topmost window (the one who receive events) can be obtained with the
 static method 
\family typewriter
getTopMost()
\family default
.
 To check if this window is the topmost, use the 
\family typewriter
isTopMost()
\family default
 method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Try 
\family typewriter
setGrabPenEvents()
\family default
 for settting to a control to redirect all pen events directly to it.
 This method speeds up pen event processing.
 Used in 
\family typewriter

\family default
 class.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You may check if this window is visible using the 
\family typewriter
isVisible()
\family default
 method.
 This method is inherited from 
\family typewriter
totalcross.ui.Control
\family default
, but it simply checks if the current window is the topmost one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Using the 
\family typewriter
setStatePosition()
\family default
 method can show PalmOS grafitti state characters.
 To hide it, call 
\family typewriter
setStatePosition(HIDE_STATE, HIDE_STATE)
\family default
.
 This method is also used in Windows CE and Pocket PC to show/hide the virtual
 keyboard (when applicable).
 Just use as parameter 
\family typewriter
VK_HIDE
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
VK_TOP
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
VK_BOTTOM
\family default
 to hide, display the virtual keyboard at the top of the screen or at the
 bottom of the screen.
 Note that this will have no effect in devices that don't have a virtual
 keyboard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Each window can have a menu attached by using the method 
\family typewriter
setMenuBar()
\family default
.
 The menuBar can be made visible programatically by calling the 
\family typewriter
popupMenuBar()
\family default
 method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Suppose you wish to allow the user to abort a task being executed by pressing.
 You can use the method 
\family typewriter

\family default
 to process all events in the queue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The methods 
\family typewriter
getPreferredWidth()
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
getPreferredHeight()
\family default
 have a special meaning for the 
\family typewriter
Window
\family default
 class.
 They return the minimum width/height needed for the correct display of
 this window.
 
\family typewriter
getPreferredWidth()
\family default
 returns the width of the title (if any) plus the width of the border (if
 any).
 
\family typewriter
getPreferredHeight()
\family default
 returns the height of the title (if any) plus the height of the border
 (if any).

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
boolean
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

highResPrepared This extremely important member is used when your program
 runs on devices with a screen resolution greater than the default 160x160
 of Palm OS.
 Some devices have 320x320, 240x320, etc.
 For each device, the font is usually proportional to the resolution.
 Since TotalCross programs are placed in a relative way, and since the relativen
ess depends on the window's size, your popped up window would look squashed
 because the windows bounds are usually set with an absolute coordinate.
 To avoid this, the window manager checks if your window is prepared for
 high resolution devices (i.e., you tested it against other resolutions and
 set the right value for the window depending on each case).
 If your window is not prepared, then the 
\family typewriter
setRect()
\family default
 method will multiply the size of the window by a factor that depends on
 how much the screen resolution has changed from the basic 160x160 (E.g.:
 in a 240x320 device, a 80x40 window will be changed to 120x80).
 Also, the window will be centered on screen.
 So, if you have tested your window in other resolutions, set this flag
 to 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
.

\begin_layout Standard
Next is explained how controls inside a window are repainted: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The programmer calls the 
\family typewriter
repaint()
\family default
 method of some controls, or a control is clicked and marks itself for repaint.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The 
\family typewriter
damageRect()
\family default
 method in class window creates a rectangle (stored in the 
\family typewriter
paintX
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
paintY
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
paintWidth
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
paintHeight
\family default
 members) with the union of the bounds of all controls marked for repaint.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The next time a VM event is posted, the 
\family typewriter
_doPaint()
\family default
 method of the topmost window is called.
 This method paints the window’s title/border (if any) and calls the 
\family typewriter
onPaint()
\family default
 method of all containers and controls that lies inside the rectangle area
 marked for repaint.
 This explains why nothing in the window is updated when you receive events
 directly from a native library (the 
\family typewriter
Scanner
\family default
 class, for example).
 Because the VM is not receiving the event, it never validates the window.
 In these cases, you must update the window yourself, calling 
\family typewriter
repaintNow()
\family default
 or the validate methods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many classes in the 
\family typewriter
totalcross.ui
\family default
 package extend 
\family typewriter
totalcross.ui.Window
\family default
.
 Examples of such classes are 
\family typewriter
CalculatorBox
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
CalendarBox
\family default
.
 Other good examples are 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

ComboBoxDropDown
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
MessageBox
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's important to be aware that it is not a good practice to create classes
 that extend 
\family typewriter
Window
\family default
 if they will occupy the whole screen, because they use a lot of memory
 to store the underlying area.
 Opening the menu may lead to time-consuming redraws of all opened windows
 due to out-of-memory problems.
 In these cases, it is better to use 
\family typewriter
Containers
\family default
.

Interface Dialogs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The TotalCross SDK provides some handy interface dialogs, which are windows
 that handles common user interaction scenarios, like displaying an informative
 message or requesting a specific user input.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Interface dialogs are pop-up windows that extend the 
\family typewriter
Window
\family default
 class, and just like 
\family typewriter
Window
\family default
, they are not automatically displayed under creation.
 To show or hide a dialog you must use 
\family typewriter
Window
\family default
 methods: 
\family typewriter
popup()
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
popupNonBlocking()
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
unpop()
\family default

\begin_layout Standard
Simple dialog used to display a text with some user-defined buttons.
 Useful for displaying informative messages or to make the user take a decision
 before proceeding (e.g.
 “Yes/No”, “Ok/Cancel”, “Save/Discard/Cancel”).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter

\labelwidthstring 0
MessageBox(String
\begin_inset space ~

title,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

\family default
 with the given title and message.
 The message is displayed using a label, and can be displayed in multiple
 lines if previously parsed with the 
\family typewriter

\backslash
n
\family default

\family typewriter
insideGap
\family default
 (space between the button's text and it's bounds) to be used by the 
\family typewriter
PushButtonGroup
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The message box is displayed on the center of the device screen, and its
 bounds are calculated based on the given title, text and buttons.
 If the text height is above the screen limits, two arrows are added to
 the message box to allow the text scrolling.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
MessageBox
\family default
 has only three instance methods:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
getPressedButtonIndex() Returns the index of the pressed button.
 This index is zero based (the first element has index 0).
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This method returns -1 if invoked before the window is closed (or if it
 is closed without any button being pressed).
 To make sure you're retrieving the correct value, consider using 
\family typewriter
popup()
\family default
 instead of 
\family typewriter
popupNonBlocking()
\family default
, or invoke this method only after the window is closed (
\family typewriter
MessageBox
\family default
 is a 
\family typewriter
Window
\family default
, so it also posts the event 
\family typewriter
ControlEvent.
 WINDOW_CLOSED
\family default
 when closed).
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
setTextAlignment(int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

align) Sets the alignment of the label that displays the text.
 The argument must be one of the following constants 
\family typewriter
LEFT
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
CENTER
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
RIGHT
\family default
.
 The default alignment is 
\family typewriter
CENTER
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
setUnpopDelay(int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

unpopDelay) Automatically unpops the message box after the given time in
 milliseconds.
 You must use this method just before displaying the window (either by 
\family typewriter
popup()
\family default
 or
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family typewriter
popupNonBlocking()
\family default
).
 This method actually adds a timer to the message box, invoking the 
\family typewriter
unpop()
\family default
 method when the 
\family typewriter
TimerEvent
\family default
 is triggered.
 Be sure to learn how the timer works to better understand this method.

\family default
.
 However, a message box created with no buttons does not provide a default
 way of being dismissed by the user.
 You must dismiss it programatically, by invoking 
\family typewriter

InputBox
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simple dialog used to get a text input from the user.
 It contains a label do display some text, an edit to receive the user input,
 and some user-defined buttons.
 Basically it's like a message box with an edit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It has two constructors:
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
The input box is displayed on the center of the device screen, and its bounds
 are calculated based on the given title, text, edit and buttons.
 If the text height is above the screen limits, two arrows are added to
 the input box to allow the text scrolling.
 And its edit receives the focus when the input box is popped up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
InputBox
\family default
 class provides the following instance methods:
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
getPressedButtonIndex() Returns the index of the pressed button.
 This index is zero based (the first element has index 0).
 This method returns -1 if invoked before the window is closed (or if it
 is closed without any button being pressed).
 To make sure you're retrieving the correct value, consider using 
\family typewriter
popup()
\family default
 instead of 
\family typewriter
popupNonBlocking()
\family default
, or invoke this method only after the window is closed (
\family typewriter
InputBox
\family default
 is a 
\family typewriter
Window
\family default
, so it also posts the event 
\family typewriter
ControlEvent.WINDOW_CLOSED
\family default
 when closed).
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
getEdit() Returns a reference to this input box's edit, so you can change
 its properties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
getValue() Returns a string with the edit's text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
setValue(String
\begin_inset space ~

value) Sets the edit with the given value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
KeyboardBox
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dialog that displays a virtual keyboard that can be used to handle text
 input either by the device's keyboard or by pen events on the virtual keyboard
 on devices with touchscreen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike other dialogs, the 
\family typewriter
KeyboardBox
\family default
 constructor does not receive any arguments, and it does not provide any
 methods for its manipulation.
 So how does it work?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the keyboard box is popped up, it gets the control of the topmost window
 that currently holds the focus.
 The control is shown at the top of the keyboard box, and any text input
 received is passed to the control as a key event.
 If the virtual keyboard is used, the keyboard box handles the pen event,
 converting it to a key event before passing to the target control.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The edit and multi edit controls may use the keyboard box for text input.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
CalculatorBox
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A dialog with a simpler calculator.
 It allows you to enter two numbers, select an operation and calculate the
 result.
 You may also paste the result or the first operand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
CalculatorBox
\family default
 class has only the default constructor and the following methods:
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
clear(boolean
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

requestFocusOnOper1) Clears everything in this calculator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
getAnswer() Returns a string with the answer the user selected to be pasted
 (the result or the first operand).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
CalendarBox
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Displays a calendar where a date can be chosen.
 It pops up with the current day as default and the user can scroll through
 months or years.
 When a day is selected the calendar is closed and you may retrieve a 
\family typewriter
Date
\family default
 object representing the chosen date.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
CalendarBox
\family default

\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList

\family default
 if the calendar is canceled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
setSelectedDate(Date
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

d) Changes this calendar box current date by the given one.
 If the given date is 
\family typewriter
null
\family default
, the current date is set to today.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To correctly retrieve the selected date, you can handle the 
\family typewriter

 event posted by the calendar, and call 
\family typewriter
getSelectedDate()
\family default
.

\begin_layout Chapter
Image
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Image is a rectangular image, which you can draw into or copy to a surface
 (using a 
\family typewriter
Graphics
\family default
 object).
 They are always 24bpp, and TotalCross supports only the PNG and JPEG formats
 when running on the TCVM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, you may still use GIF and BMP files on your application, because
 these formats are also supported when running on Java, and the TotalCross
 deployer automatically converts those files to 24bpp PNG files, which are
 then packaged with your application (along with any other required resources).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
Image
\family default
 objects cannot be directly added to the user interface because they are
 not controls (i.e.
 the 
\family typewriter
Image
\family default
 class does not extend the 
\family typewriter
Control
\family default
 class).
 To display an image on the user interface, you may either use the 
\family typewriter
Graphics
\family default
 object to draw the image on the screen, or use a control that better suits
 your needs, like 
\family typewriter
ImageControl
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
Button
\family default
 (both described at the user interface section of this document).
\end_layout

 The new image has the same color depth and color map of the default drawing
 surface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
Image(byte[]
\begin_inset space ~

 its headers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
Image(String

 runtime, you may use the static method 
\family typewriter
Image.isSupported(String filename)

\begin_layout Itemize
To retrieve the image dimensions, you may use the methods 
\family typewriter
getWidth()
\family default
 and

\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The method 
\family typewriter
getGraphics()

 for drawing in this image.
\end_layout

You may change all pixels of the same color by another color with the method
 
\family typewriter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The deployer also convert animated GIFs into multi-frame PNGs – which are
 regular PNG files that contains all frames from the original GIF, along
 with the number of frames – to be packaged with the application's tclass
 file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case, you may use the method 
\family typewriter
getFrameCount()
\family default
 to check if the loaded image contains more than one frame.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, you may want to load an actual PNG or JPEG file created in multi-frame
 format to display an animation.
 In this case, the number of frames contained in the file will be unknown
 and 
\family typewriter
getFrameCount()
\family default
 will return 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To set the actual number of frames of the image, you must use the method
 
\family typewriter
setFrameCount (int n)
\family default
, which sets the total number of frames of the image by the given one, but
 only if the total image width (including all frames) is divisible by the
 given value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The image's frame count cannot be changed if their value is already higher
 than 1.
 In this case, the 
\family typewriter
setFrameCount()
\family default
 method simply returns without doing anything.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following methods should be used only on multi-frame images.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
getCurrentFrame() Returns the index of the current visible frame.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
setCurrentFrame(int
\begin_inset space ~

nr) Sets the given frame index as the current frame, moving its contents
 to the set of visible pixels.
 If the given index is negative, the last frame is set as the current frame;
 if it's higher than the number of frames, the first one is set instead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
nextFrame() Sets the next frame as the current one.

\begin_layout Section
Vector
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
Vector
\family default
 class implements a growable array of objects.
 Like an array, it contains components that can be accessed using an integer
 index.
 However, the size of a 
\family typewriter
Vector
\family default
 can dynamically grow as needed.
 If the array never needs to be increased, an array should be used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Java you cannot directly access the 
\family typewriter
Vector
\family default
's internal array, you must use its methods to 
\family typewriter
insert()
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
remove()
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
retrieve()
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
replace()
\family default
 elements in a 
\family typewriter
Vector
\family default
.
 This way the programmer cannot accidentally (or intentionally) corrupt
 the object's internal state.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately this makes 
\family typewriter
Vector
\family default
 iteration a very costly operation, because each iteration requires at least
 one method call.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To avoid this performance issue, TotalCross' 
\family typewriter
Vector
\family default
 implementation allows public access to its internal array.
 However, to guarantee the Vector's integrity
\emph on
 you must only access it to retrieve (get) or replace (set) elements, and
 never to insert, remove, or resize the buffer
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may also use a 
\family typewriter
Vector
\family default
 as a stack, which feature is better explained below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
Vector
\family default
 has three constructors:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
Vector() Default constructor, creates a 
\family typewriter
Vector
\family default
 with the default size 8.

\begin_layout Section
Logger
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\family typewriter
Logger
\family default
 object is used to log messages for a specific system or application component.
 Loggers are usually named using a hierarchical dot-separated namespace.
 Logger names can be arbitrary strings, but they should usually be based
 on the package name or class name of the logged component, such as 
\family typewriter
totalcross.net
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
totalcross.io
\family default
.
 In addition it is possible to retrieve one global "anonymous" logger that
 can be used in the whole system.
 A logger can be created or retrieved (if it already exists) by 
\family typewriter
getLogger()
\family default
.
 To dispose a logger after using it, just call 
\family typewriter
dispose()
\family default
 and it will be permanently discarded (it will be closed and it won't be
 possible to use it anymore).
 To log a message, you may call the 
\family typewriter
log()
\family default
 method or any of the other convenience methods (
\family typewriter
info()
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
severe()
\family default

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
Time
\family default
 class stores a specific a date and time.
 The year must have 4 digits and the hour is numbered in 24-hour notation,
 which is the international standard notation of time, and may also be referred
 as military time or astronomical time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For performance reasons, the 
\family typewriter
Time
\family default
 fields have public access.
 So you can directly access the field day to get or set its value, instead
 of calling a method.
 However, that makes the 
\family typewriter
Time
\family default
 objects unsafe because the fields' values are not checked when they are
 set, and may not be within the field valid range.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the fields can be set without any kind of validation, it would be
 pointless to add validation to the other methods, therefore, 
\emph on
the Time fields' values are never validated by any method or constructor
\emph default
.
 So you must know and always respect the fields' range, and never set a
 field with a variable without first checking if the value is withing range
 (for instance, let the user type the hour in an edit and simply convert
 it to 
\family typewriter
int
\family default
 and set the 
\family typewriter
hour
\family default
 field, without checking if its value is between 0 and 23).

CharacterConvert
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class is used to correctly handle international character conversions.
 The default character scheme converter is the 8859-1 (ISO Latin 1).
 If you want to use a different one, you must extend this class, implementing
 the 
\family typewriter
bytes2chars()
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
chars2bytes()
\family default
 methods, and then assign the public member of 
\family typewriter
Convert.charConverter
\family default
 to use your class instead of this default one.
 You can also use the method 
\family typewriter
Convert.setDefaultConverter()
\family default
 to change it, passing, as parameter, the prefix of your 
\family typewriter
CharacterConverter
\family default
 class (better look at the implementation to know what to pass on).

\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
appSettingsBin Application defined settings, stored as a byte array.
 If you set the value of this field to something other than 
\family typewriter
null
\family default
, the VM will save it when exiting and load it when restarting.
 On Palm OS, the value is stored in the unsaved preferences database, which
 is not backed up during hot-sync.
 On the desktop, a file named 
\family typewriter
settings4<application id>.pdb
\family default
 stores the 
\family typewriter
appSettingsBin
\family default
 for the current running TotalCross program.
 On Windows 32 and Windows CE, this data is saved in the registry.
 Use this to save small amount of data, up to 2 or 4 kb maximum.
 This property is saved only at the application's exit; you can force an
 update by calling 
\family typewriter
Settings.refresh()
\family default
.
 Here's a sample of how to use it: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family default
, the VM will save it when exiting and load it when restarting.
 This is stored in the same way as the previous property.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
appSecretKey Application defined secret key.
 Similar to the above property.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
applicationId The application's ID.
 MUST BE CHANGED IN THE STATIC INITIALIZER! Used by the deployer and by
 the virtual machine.
 On Palm OS, all data created is assigned to an application id.
 So when a program is uninstalled, all of its data is also removed from
 device.
 On Android, when the single package option is passed to 
\family typewriter
tc.Deploy
\family default
 (
\family typewriter
/p
\family default
), the application's package is changed to 
\family typewriter
totalcross.app<application id>
\family default
.
 On BlackBerry, it is used to define the folder where the application is
 stored.
 It must have 4 letters or digits, and the first character must be a letter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList

dataPath Specifies the directory where the files should be read/written.
 Used on the desktop when:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Running under Windows 32 VM.
 Can be specified anywhere.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Running under JDK, as application (java.exe).
 Can also be specified with the 
\family typewriter

\family default
commandline parameter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some warnings: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If this member is not 
\family typewriter
null
\family default
, any paths specified for the file are replaced by this path.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Slashes are normalized by the VM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The path existence is not verified on Windows 32.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Changing this member also changes the place where local libraries are loaded
 (global libraries are loaded when the VM starts, before the application
 is initialized).
 So, before loading any library, change this member back to 
\family typewriter
null
\family default
 (unless the library is also in the 
\family typewriter
dataPath
\family default
).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The system ensures that the datapath ends with a slash, if you don't put
 one.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList

romSerialNumber Field that represents the ROM serial number for this device.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\series bold
Important
\series default
: don't rely only on this information to uniquely identify a device! Its
 very easy to change this number, and it won't be available in all devices.
 It will contain 
\family typewriter
null
\family default
 if unavailable, such as some Palm OS 5 devices, like Treo 6xx.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\series bold
Note
\series default
: this was correctly tested; you can ensure that your Palm OS device has
 or not a serial number pressing App/Info/Version: the serial number will
 appear in the top; if nothing appears, it means that the device doesn't
 have a serial number.
 If it appears but nothing is returned from here, it means that the device
 has a non-standard function that retrieves the serial number, and thus
 we don't support it.
 On Android 3.0 or greater it will have the serial number; On Androids 1.x
 and 2.x it will have a consistent number that MAY be the same across resets,
 but has no relation to the real serial number.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
showSecrets Field that represents if the PDA has a password and the user
 choosen to hide the secret records (via the Apps/Security/Current Privacy).
 Returns 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
 in all other cases.
 Specific for Palm OS (the other devices do not let the user hide records).
 This can be used to let the operating system do the login for a program
 that requires privacy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
keypadOnly Field that represents if this device has a keypad only (BlackBerry
 only).
 On such devices, presses in the 1-9 and *# pops up the 
\family typewriter
KeyPad
\family default
 class (used in phones without alpha keys).
 You can set 
\family typewriter
keypadOnly
\family default
 to enable/disable the the 
\family typewriter
KeyPad
\family default
 popup.
 The disabling occurs everytime a non-digit is pressed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
keyboardFocusTraversable Defines if the arrow keys will be used to change
 the focus using the keyboard.
 Note that some controls will behave differently.
 It will be 
\family typewriter

\family default
 for pen less devices, and it may be changed if your application wants to
 use navigation keys to change the focus between the controls.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
deviceId Field that represents a device id that can be used to identify
 the device's name.
 For Palm OS devices, see: 
\begin_inset CommandInset href

.
 For Windows CE devices, it will have the device's name.
 For Windows 32 VM, it will have the computer name.
 On iOS devices it will have the model identifier.
 If the device can't be identified, it will contain 
\family typewriter
null
\family default

\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
vmPath The main path used to derive 
\family typewriter
appPath
\family default
 and also to store TotalCross global files.
 This is a read-only property: changing it will have no effect.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
appPath The path from where the application is running from.
 On Palm OS devices, it will be 
\family typewriter

\family default
.
 This is the default location where the files are created.
 This is a read-only property: changing it will have no effect.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
closeButtonType Set it at the application's static initializer.
 If set to 
\family typewriter
MINIMIZE_BUTTON
\family default
, replaces the ok button on Windows CE devices, which closes the application,
 by the x one, which just minimizes the application.
 The ok closes the application, and the x minimizes it.
 By default, it is 
\family typewriter
CLOSE_BUTTON
\family default
, which closes the application.
 On BlackBerry, if this is set to 
\family typewriter
CLOSE_BUTTON
\family default
, the application is closed when the END key is pressed; otherwise, it is
 sent to background (minimized).
 The default behavior is sending the application to background (set to 
\family typewriter
MINIMIZE_BUTTON
\family default
).
 It cans also be 
\family typewriter
NO_BUTTON
\family default
, which will remove the x/ok button from screen on Windows CE devices.
 On Windows 32, the x button will still be visible, but clicking on it will
 not close the application.
 If the device does not support removing the button, it will change to a
 
\family typewriter
MINIMIZE_BUTTON
\family default
, which is the default on CE devices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
isFullScreen Set it at the application's static initializer.
 Makes the application full screen.
 Only a simple assignment to 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
 is supported; you cannot check the platform nor any other attribute of
 this class because the static initializer is called BEFORE this class has
 its fields set.
 Also, some platforms set it at deploying time.
 Note that Android applications are always full screen.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
fullScreenPlatforms Set this to a list of platforms that will set the fullscreen
 mode.
 If this member is 
\family typewriter
null
\family default
, all platforms will have full screen set to the 
\family typewriter
isFullScreen
\family default
 member.
 You can use any separator.
 The only platform that does not work with this is Java.
 You must provide a string like the one above, concatenating the platform
 strings in a single line.
 Using a 
\family typewriter
StringBuffer
\family default
 or anything else may result in incorrect results.
 Here's a sample, to use full screen on Windows devices (but not Windows
 desktop):

 does not support moving the Soft Input Panel to the top.
 Otherwise, the SIP (Soft Input Panel) will be placed on top of the

\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
SIPBottomLimit The limit that will make the Soft Input Panel be placed at
 bottom.
 If the control's absolute rect is < this value, the SIP will stay at the
 bottom of the screen (otherwise, it will be moved to the top).
 Before TotalCross 1.3, this value used to be the half of the screen, but
 since in some new Windows Mobile the SIP is very tall (specially in landscape
 mode), we added this field so you can change it if desired.
 For example, to set to 5 times the font's height, do: 
\family typewriter
Settings.SIPBottomLimit = 5 * fmH;
\family default
 Setting it to -1 (default value) will use half the current screen height.
 This field is used in Windows CE devices only.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
uiAdjustmentsBasedOnFontHeight Set to 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
 to make the extra adjustment values used in the relative positioning be
 a percentage of the control's font height.
 In modern devices, a single pixel can have different sizes in inches (or,
 in other words, the devices have different screen densities).
 So, something like 
\family typewriter
PREFERRED+4
\family default
 in a 320x480 device with 160 DPI (DIPS PER INCH - or pixels per inch) will
 have the half size of a device with the same resolution but 320 DPI.
 Since the font sizes change according to the DPI and not the resolution,
 its good to change the relative positioning to use a percentage of the
 font's height instead of absolute pixels.
 By setting this flag to true will make the adjustment a PERCENTAGE of the
 font's height.
 So, you can use something like 
\family typewriter
PREFERRED+50
\family default
 (50% of font's height), 
\family typewriter
SAME+150
\family default
 (150% of font's height), and so on.
 It is possible to disable the adjustment for a single 
\family typewriter

\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
useNewFont Change to 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
 to use the new font added in version 1.3.
 The main difference between the old and the new fonts is that the new one
 was generated INSIDE an Android emulator, thus, it uses the Android's True
 Type Font engine, which is far better than the Java's engine, used to generate
 the old font.
 Thus, the new font has a better appearance, and its also a bit smaller
 than the old font (the new height is about 2 below the old height, so if
 you used 20 for the old font, you should use 22 for the new one).
 To have your application's font optimzed for all platforms, start by using
 the new font.
 Android's default font size is computed based on the new font.
 Using the old font on Android will result in less-than optimal results
 on Android devices.
 The standard VM installation files includes both new and old font files.
 However, if you use the 
\family typewriter
tc.Deploy
\family default
 option that generates a single package (
\family typewriter
/p
\family default
), only the choosen font will be packaged.
 You must change this property at the application's static initializer.

When calling a TotalCross program, you can pass a command line parameter
 to the calling application, just placing the parameters in the proper argument.
 It can be retrieved with

\family default
 name, and all the other arguments must be in the 
\family typewriter

\family default
Important notes about path separators:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

• We always tell to use / as the path separator.
 
\family typewriter
Vm.exec()
\family default
 must be used differently of the other places, because you don't pass only
 paths in the

args
\family default
 parameter, pass other things too.
 So, when you use a path in 
\family typewriter

\family typewriter

\backslash

\family default
 or 
\family typewriter

\family typewriter
Vm.exec()
\family default
 we can't do that, for example, changing 
\family typewriter
/c start
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter

\backslash
c start
\family default
 will make the execution fail.
 So, you'll have to choose the right separator in the parameters.

• Make sure that, on Windows, the paths and parameters use 
\family typewriter

\backslash

\backslash

\family default

\family default
 as path separator, or the command will not run.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline

If you're using 
\family typewriter
/cmd
\family default
 and the command fails, change 
\family typewriter
/c
\family default
 option to 
\family typewriter
/k
\family default
, which will keep the open window instead of closing it, so you can see
 the error cause.

On BlackBerry, the command must be a module name.
 For instance, you can open TotalCross programs, just providing its module
 (
\family typewriter
.cod
\family default
) name.
 The command below launchs a URL:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family typewriter

To be able to find what's the class name of a program you want to launch,
 install it on the Android Emulator (which is inside the Android SDK) and
 run the Dev Tools / Package Browser.
 Then click on the package, and click in the desired Activities button.
 The command parameter for 
\family typewriter
Vm.exec()
\family default
 is the process description, and the 
\family typewriter
args
\family default
 parameter is the activitie's name.
 Note, however, that there's no guarantee that the program will be available
 in a real device.
\begin_inset Newline newline

On Android, if you're calling a TotalCross program, the wait parameter is
 ignored (and defaults to false).
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

When calling this method, usually 0 is returned if no error occured, or
 a system error code.
 -999 means that the file was not found.
 On Android, 0 is always returned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
setAutoOff(boolean
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

enabled) Enables or disables device automatic turn-off, which happens after
 a period of inactivity of the device.
 If you disable the auto-off, the original auto-off time will be restored
 automatically when the program exits.
 Keeping the device always on is desired only when you're working with sockets.
 Use it carefully, because it drains the battery.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList

 execution for the given number of milliseconds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
safeSleep(int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

millis) Causes the VM (or the current thread, if called from it) to pause
 execution for aproximately the given number of milliseconds.
 This method does not block the user interface engine, as 
\family typewriter
Vm.sleep()
\family default
 does, since it keeps calling 
\family typewriter
Window.pumpEvents()
\family default
.
 So, if you rotate the screen during a 
\family typewriter
Vm.sleep()
\family default
, the rotation is blocked; but during a 
\family typewriter
Vm.safeSleep()
\family default
, the rotation occurs normally.
 Button presses and other user interface operation also occurs normally
 during this method.
 Obviously, if you call 
\family typewriter
Vm.safeSleep(100)
\family default
 and a screen rotation (or any other event) occurs, this method will take
 to return much more than 100 ms.
 This method only makes sense for sleeps above 500 ms, unless you're calling
 it from a loop (which is reasonable to keep calling it), and should not
 be called from threads.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList

getFreeMemory() Returns the free memory on the device.
 Returns a maximum of 2 GB free, even if the device has more than that.
 On Java and Windows 32, the result might be not reasonable after some operation
s because of the virtual memory usage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
gc() Calls the Garbage Collector.
 Usually, this isn't necessary; the

 it before running a memory-consuming routine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList

SpecialKeys
\family default
 or pass device-specific constants, which can be retrieved calling 
\family typewriter
Vm.showKeyCodes(true)
\family default

 Note that the HOME key cannot be intercepted on Android due to OS restrictions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
isKeyDown(int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

key) Gets the current keys being pressed.
 You must set which keys you want to receive notification with the 
\family typewriter
interceptSpecialKeys()
\family default
 method.
 Note that you can use this method to verify if more than one key is pressed
 at once, just keep pooling with this method to see when a state has changed.
 If you just want to intercept the key with a single press, handle it in
 the 
\family typewriter
onEvent()
\family default
 method, with a 
\family typewriter
KeyEvent
\family default
 event.

 Otherwise, all debugged strings will go to the file.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

You can delete the debug memo/txt file passing the

, a constant string declared in this class.
 E.g.: 
\family typewriter
Vm.debug(Vm.ERASE_DEBUG);

s) Shows an alert IMMEDIATELY on screen.
 It uses the sytem message box to show the alert, not the

Note that unicode characters are not displayed on alerts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList

warning(String
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

s) This function can be used to show permanent warnings.
 It was created because 
\family typewriter
Vm.debug()
\family default
 is, in theory, just for debugging.
 Some TotalCross classes display warnings to the user, and are not debug
 (i.
 e., temporary) messages.
 It just calls 
\family typewriter
Vm.debug("Warning! "+s)
\family default
, so it differs from it only in a semanthical way.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline

\family default
 where this one resides, or in some attached library (or JAR, if application
 is running in a browser).
 The returned array is a fake pointer; does NOT point directly to the file
 (a new buffer is created to store the contents).
 In this example the TotalCross deployer will insert the 
\family typewriter

 In systems that can have an auxiliary battery, it will return the sum of
 the main and the auxiliary battery, but this sum will always be limited
 to 100%.
 On the desktop, it will always return 100.
 Note that in some OSes, when on the cradle, the returned value may be 100%
 even when charging.

\labelwidthstring 0
tweak(int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

param,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

boolean
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

set) Tweak some parameters of the virtual machine.
 Note that these parameters are only available on the device, NOT when running
 as Java.
 Also, the configuration is not persisted: you must set this every time
 you run the program.
 Each tweak must be made separately; they are NOT bit masks.
 For example: 
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Vm.tweak(Vm.TWEAK_AUDIBLE_GC,true);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Vm.tweak(Vm.TWEAK_DUMP_MEM_STATS,true); 
\end_layout

\end_inset

The possible parameters are:
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

TWEAK_AUDIBLE_GC
\family default
 Each time the garbage collector runs, it will issue a beep.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family typewriter
TWEAK_DUMP_MEM_STATS 
\family default
When the program ends, it will dump the memory status of the program with
 the following information: 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

• Times 
\family typewriter
gc()
\family default
 was called: number of times the garbage collector was called.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

• Total GC time: total time in milisseconds that the GC took.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

• Chunks created: number of chunks (block of memory used to store objects,
 each one with 65500 bytes).
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

• Max allocated: maximum memory allocated.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family typewriter
TWEAK_MEM_PROFILER 
\family default
Computes the maximum memory in use between two consecutive calls.
 For example: 
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Vm.debug("P Starting profiler for xxxx"); 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Vm.tweak(Vm.TWEAK_MEM_PROFILER,true); // now run the program during some time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Vm.tweak(Vm.TWEAK_MEM_PROFILER,false);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Vm.debug("P Stopping profiler for xxxx"); 
\end_layout

\end_inset

When it starts, it prints the currently used memory.
 When you set it off, it will dump the currently used memory (if different
 of the maximum), and then the maximum memory used between the two calls.
 For example:
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

P Now allocated: 40852408 // printed when turning on
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

P Now allocated: 1137060 // printed when turning off
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

P Max allocated: 40868844 // printed when turning off
\end_layout

\end_inset

All profiler messages are prefixed with 
\family typewriter
P
\family default
 in the debug console, because it makes easy to filter them.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family typewriter
TWEAK_DISABLE_GC
\family default
 Disables the Garbage Collector.
 This can greatly decrease the time to load some things, but note that you
 must re-enable it later, otherwise, the system will run out of memory quickly.
 Example: 
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Vm.tweak(TWEAK_DISABLE_GC,true);
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Vm.tweak(TWEAK_DISABLE_GC,false); // the gc is automatically called here
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

The parameter 
\family typewriter
set 
\family default
indicates if the passed parameter is to be set (
\family typewriter
true
\family default
) or unset (
\family typewriter
false
\family default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
getStackTrace(Throwable
\begin_inset space ~

t) Returns the given throwable stack trace as a string.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
showKeyCodes(boolean
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

on) Set to 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
 to popup an alert for each key pressed.
 This is useful for you to discover key codes that may be intercepted with
 
\family typewriter
Vm.interceptSpecialKeys()
\family default
.
 Note that this will probably block the application and you will have to
 provide a button to exit from it or just reset the device.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

On Windows CE, the key 91 is always displayed when a hotkey is pressed,
 so the VM will silently ignore it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
turnScreenOn(boolean
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

on) Turns the screen on or off, but keeps the device running.
 This greatly improves battery performance.

preallocateArray(Object
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

sample,
\begin_inset space ~

int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

length) This method pre-allocates space for an array of objects with the
 given length.
 It can reduce the number of calls to GC when allocating big arrays.
 If the total size (
\family typewriter
Object size * length
\family default
) is small, calling this method is useless and will not result in any performanc
e gain.
 You can always measure how the GC affects your program by doing this: 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This is a sample that pre-allocates space for a 
\family typewriter

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this part is to teach you how to use the classes in the 
\family typewriter
totalcross.io
\family default
 package.
 The classes that will be covered in this tutorial are outlined below:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
totalcross.io.device.PortConnector
\family default
: used to send and receive bytes via Serial Cradle, USB, IrComm, and Bluetooth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
totalcross.io.File
\family default
: used to create files and manage directories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
totalcross.io.ByteArrayStream
\family default
: a resizable buffer that can be used to feed data to a stream or to store
 data coming from a stream.
 It can be used to emulate a virtual stream.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
totalcross.io.DataStream
\family default
 (and 
\family typewriter
DataStreamLE
\family default
): used to read/write primitive types and strings in Big Endian (default)
 or Little Endian format.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
totalcross.io.Stream
\family default
: is the main class of all classes inside the 
\family typewriter
totalcross.io
\family default
 package.
 It can be viewed as a generic stream where data can flow in and out of
 the device.
 All classes inside package 
\family typewriter
totalcross.io
\family default
 extend this class, and most classes receive a 
\family typewriter
totalcross.io.Stream
\family default
 in their constructor parameter.
 This allows you to combine different streams to meet your needs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
totalcross.io.device.gps.GPS 
\family default
retrieves GPS coordinates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family typewriter
totalcross.io.device.RadioDevice
\family default
 provides access to the device's radios and information about their status.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Stream
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
Stream
\family default
 is an abstract class that serves as the base class for all classes that
 handles I/O operations.
 It defines the interface and the basic behavior that all its subclasses
 must implement.

These three methods may throw an 
\family typewriter
IOException
\family default
, which usually means that something out of our control went wrong, preventing
 the method to be executed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
Stream
\family default
 subclasses usually throw more exceptions that extends 
\family typewriter
IOException
\family default
 to denote more specific problems and allow you to properly handle the situation
, like 
\family typewriter
FileNotFoundException
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
Streams
\family default
 subclasses can be divided into two main groups:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Classes that actually perform I/O operations, like 
\family typewriter
File
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
Socket
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Classes that wrap a stream, providing features or operations that can be
 applied to any other stream, like 
\family typewriter
DataStream
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
BufferedStream
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We'll first look into this last group, which provides easier and more efficient
 ways of reading and writing data.

ByteArrayStream

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
ByteArrayStream
\family default
 is a 
\family typewriter
Stream
\family default
 that has an internal growable byte array, and it is commonly used as a
 buffer.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In I/O operations, usually it's faster and/or less resource consuming to
 send larger chunks of data at once, instead of sending several small chunks
 of data.
 You may use a byte array stream as a buffer and wait until it reaches a
 minimum size performing any actual I/O operation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sample code:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Plain Layout

Socket s = new Socket(host, 8080); // connect to our host
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This difference is easily noticeable when dealing with external connections,
 like socket or port connector, but don't forget their operations usually
 have a time limit (timeout), that must be adjusted according to your connection
 speed and the amount of data you want to be able to read or write in a
 single I/O operation.
 Using a low timeout to send or receive large amounts of data may cause
 problems.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may also use a byte array stream with data stream to ensure you received
 enough data before handling it.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The byte array stream is usually used as a read-only or write-only buffer,
 because its internal cursor is advanced every time a read or write operation

 This is specially useful for streams that handle external connections,
 like

Be careful when using this method with streams like file.
 It may read the whole file at once, resulting in a great loss of performance
 and resources (the buffer may be resized several times).
 In the worst scenario, the device will run out of memory and the application
 will be halted.
 In this case, you should check the size of the stream before using 
\family typewriter
readFully()
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The argument 
\family typewriter
bufSize
\family default
 specifies a minimum size for the internal buffer – therefore, if its value
 is equals or lower than the size of the buffer, it is not resized (i.e.
 you cannot use it to shrink the buffer).
 Otherwise, the buffer will be resized to match the given value.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Please notice, the buffer will still grow if necessary, regardless of the
 
\family typewriter
bufSize
\family default
 value.
 So you cannot use it to limit the amount of data read, and you may specify
 a value 0 or lower if you do not wish to define a minimum size – this will
 not prevent its automatic resize.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The byte array stream is reseted at the beginning of 
\family typewriter
readFully()

 argument 
\family typewriter
retryCount
\family default
 instead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Calling the method reset before

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
After

readFully()

 finishes reading to the internal buffer, it marks the current cursor position

\begin_layout Standard
Being able to persist and retrieve data is very important for any application

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
File
\family default
 class was designed to allow you to browse and manipulate the file system
 – with its directories and archives – of any supported device in a transparent
 and reliable manner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A

 stored either on its non-volatile memory or in a memory card inserted on
 the device.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When creating a new

\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList

DONT_OPEN The path argument denotes either a directory or an archive that
 may not exist.
 The given path is stored but the file isn't actually accessed (i.e.
 no resource is locked to manipulate the file).
\begin_inset Newline newline

This mode may be used to perform operations that do not require the allocation
 of any resources, or to manipulate directories.
 In fact, it is the only mode that allows directory manipulation.

When creating a new file, you may start the path using the alias 
\family typewriter
device/
\family default
, which evaluates to the platform's base user directory: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

totalcross.app.<application id>
\family default
 if using single package 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The alias is ALWAYS relative to the built in storage, regardless of the
 value passed to the argument slot.
 On iOS and Android, if you don't specify a path, the file will be open
 in 
\family typewriter
device/
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The argument slot specifies the index of the storage media to be used only
 for Palm OS.
 This parametes is ignored on all other platforms.
 Usually the value used will be 1, which defaults to the device's internal
 non-volatile memory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the device has one or more slots for external storage medias (e.g.
 MM Cards and SD Cards), you may access them using a value greater than
 1 (e.g.
 if the device has one slot for a memory card, you may address it using
 the value 2).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may also use the value -1 to access the storage media of higher index
 (i.e.
 1 if no external media is available, 2 if one external media is available,
 and so on...).
 0, the internal memory, MUST NOT be used, because it will cause a device
 reset.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This may vary on some Palm devices, so use prefer using the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Depending on the target file type (directory or archive) and the used open

 Using a method under the wrong circumstances will result in an

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To clarify, we'll split the 
\family typewriter
File
\family default
 methods into the four categories below:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Archive and directory methods – May be used with any file, regardless of
 the type and the open mode.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Directory only methods – Can only be used with directories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Archive only methods – Can only be used with open archives (cannot be used
 with archives created in 
\family typewriter
DONT_OPEN
\family default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Behavior depends on the file type – May be used with any file, but the method
 implementation and result depends on the file type.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Archive and Directory methods:
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
exists() Returns 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
 if the file exists and 
\family typewriter
false
\family default
, otherwise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
isDir() Returns 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
 if and only if the file exists and is a directory, returning 
\family typewriter
false
\family default
, otherwise.
 To check if a file is an archive, you must test if the file is not a directory
 and if the file exists.
 Obviously this method should only be used in mode 
\family typewriter
DONT_OPEN
\family default
, since it will always return 
\family typewriter
false
\family default
 in any other mode.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
getParent() Returns a new 
\family typewriter
File
\family default
 object that references this file's parent directory, or 
\family typewriter

\family default
 if this file does not have a parent directory.
 The new file object is created in 
\family typewriter

\family default
 mode.

\begin_layout Section
File attributes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As shown above, you may use the methods 
\family typewriter

\family default
 to retrieve or change the attributes of an archive (these operations are
 not supported for directories) with the following constants:

Usually a file has three attributes which represents its creation time,
 the last time it was accessed and the last time it was modified.
 TotalCross provides the following constants to be used with the methods
 
\family typewriter
setTime()
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter

\family default
 to retrieve and change these attributes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList

TIME_MODIFIED Used to get or set the time the file was last modified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList

GPS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
GPS
\family default
 is a class that retrieves GPS coordinates read from the COM (or Bluetooth,
 or IR) port on Palm OS.
 Windows Mobile, Android, BlackBerry, and iOS use the native API instead
 of reading from the COM port.
 This class only retrieves data updating the internal fields.
 If you want to display that data, you may use the 
\family typewriter
GPSView
\family default
 class.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the GPS fails connecting to the satellites, and the phone has signal,
 you can use the cell tower location as a rough location.
 The precision varies between 50m to 3km, depending on the phone location.
 In this case, you can get the latitude and longitude using 
\family typewriter
CellInfo.toCoordinates()
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On Android, don't forget to turn on the GPS, going to Settings / Security
 & Location / Enable GPS satellites.
 The other platforms may require that as well.

GoogleMaps class
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Shows a Google Maps viewer on a separate window.
 Internet connection is required.
 Currently works on Android and iOS only.
 Pressing back returns to the application on Android.
 On iPhone you must do a double-click on the home button to open the task
 manager to return to your application.
 This class only has a default constructor and a method, which is described
 below:
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
showAddress(String
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

address,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

boolean
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

showSatellitePhotos) Shows the given address in a separate window.
 If you want to show your current location, you will have to turn the GPS
 on, get the coordinates and pass to this method.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The 
\family typewriter
address
\family default
 parameter is the address to show (e.
 g.
 
\family typewriter
"rua tonelero 10, copacabana, rio de janeiro, brasil"
\family default
, or 
\family typewriter
"22030,brasil"
\family default
).
 The address is resolved and its latitude and logitude coordinates are retrieved.
 You must be careful with the address given, be sure to make some tests
 before.
 If you want to pass the lat/lon coordinates, pass them in the form: 
\family typewriter
"@lat,lon"
\family default
 (e.
 g.: 
\family typewriter
"@-22.966000,-43.185000"
\family default
).
 Note that, due to Android's restrictions, only the first 6 decimal digits
 in the coordinates are used.
 Passing an empty string will make the engine search for a valid "last known
 position".
 If there's no such position, it will return 
\family typewriter
false
\family default
.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

If 
\family typewriter
showSatellitePhotos == true
\family default
, an image of the satellite is combined with the map.
 May require more bandwidth and Internet resources.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The method returns 
\family typewriter
true
\family default
 if the map was shown; 
\family typewriter
false
\family default
, otherwise.
 
\family typewriter
false
\family default
 is often returned when there's no Internet connection.

\begin_layout Part
COMPRESSION
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapterstar
Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section covers the usage of classes that handle data compression, inflating
 compressed data or deflating uncompressed data using streams.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
CompressedStream
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Abstract class used as the basis for compression filters, such as 
\family typewriter
ZLibStream
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
GZipStream
\family default
.
 It is the base class for stream filters that perform data compression and
 decompression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instances of subclasses of 
\family typewriter
CompressedStream
\family default
 cannot be used for both read and write operations.
 At the object creation, you MUST choose if the new object is going to be
 used either for reading or writing compressed data, by passing one of the
 following constants to the class constructor:
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
DEFLATE Used to create a stream for data compression.
 In this mode, you may ONLY use write operations, that is, you may NOT use
 the method 
\family typewriter
readBytes()
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
INFLATE Used to create a stream for data decompression.
 In this mode, you may ONLY use read operations, that is, you may NOT use
 the method 
\family typewriter
writeBytes()
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Box Shadowbox
position "t"
hor_pos "c"
has_inner_box 1
inner_pos "t"
use_parbox 0
use_makebox 0
width "100line%"
special "none"
height "1in"
height_special "totalheight"
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Subclasses of 
\family typewriter
CompressedStream
\family default
 that implements algorithms with different levels of compression, should
 always use a constant default value for data compression.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also notice that closing a compressed stream (using its 
\family typewriter
close()
\family default
 method) DOES NOT affect the underlying stream (the stream passed to the
 constructor).
 To also close the underlying stream, you must call its own 
\family typewriter
close()
\family default
 method after closing the compressed stream.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The methods for reading and writing bytes are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
readBytes(byte[]
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

buf,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

start,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

count) Attempts to read 
\family typewriter
count
\family default
 bytes to the given byte array 
\family typewriter
buf
\family default
, starting from offset 
\family typewriter
start
\family default
.
 This method should be used only for reading compressed data from the original
 stream, returning uncompressed data on the give byte array.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
writeBytes(byte[]
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

buf,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

start,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

count) Attempts to write 
\family typewriter
count
\family default
 bytes from the given byte array 
\family typewriter
buf
\family default
, starting from offset 
\family typewriter
start
\family default
.
 This method should be used only for compressing the contents of the given
 byte array and writing the compressed data to the original stream.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
ZLibStream
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Subclass of 
\family typewriter
CompressedStream
\family default
 that implements data compression using the zlib algorithm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It uses its super class methods and has the following constructor:
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
ZLibStream(Stream
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

stream,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

int
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

mode) Creates a 
\family typewriter
ZLibStream
\family default
 object that may be used to read compressed data from the given stream,
 or to write compressed data to the given stream.
 The mode must be either 
\family typewriter

\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
INFLATE
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
“zlib is designed to be a free, general-purpose, legally unencumbered --

Adler32 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Computes an Adler-32 checksum for a stream of data.
 An Adler-32 checksum is not as reliable as a CRC32 checksum, but a lot
 faster to compute.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The specification for Adler-32 may be found in RFC 1950 (ZLIB Compressed
 Data Format Specification version 3.3).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From that document: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"ADLER32 (Adler-32 checksum) This contains a checksum value of the uncompressed
 data (excluding any dictionary data) computed according to Adler-32 algorithm.
 This algorithm is a 32-bit extension and improvement of the Fletcher algorithm,
 used in the ITU-T X.224 / ISO 8073 standard.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adler-32 is composed of two sums accumulated per byte: 
\family typewriter
s1
\family default
 is the sum of all bytes, 
\family typewriter
s2
\family default
 is the sum of all 
\family typewriter
s1
\family default
 values.
 Both sums are done modulo 65521.
 
\family typewriter
s1
\family default
 is initialized to 1, 
\family typewriter
s2
\family default
 to zero.
 The Adler-32 checksum is stored as 
\family typewriter
s2*65536 + s1
\family default
 in most-significant-byte first (network) order." 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
"8.2.
 The Adler-32 algorithm 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Adler-32 algorithm is much faster than the CRC32 algorithm yet still
 provides an extremely low probability of undetected errors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The modulo on unsigned long accumulators can be delayed for 5552 bytes,
 so the modulo operation time is negligible.
 If the bytes are 
\family typewriter
a
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
b
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
c
\family default
, the second sum is 
\family typewriter
3a + 2b + c + 3
\family default
, and so is position and order sensitive, unlike the first sum, which is
 just a checksum.
 That 65521 is prime is important to avoid a possible large class of two-byte
 errors that leave the check unchanged (the Fletcher checksum uses 255,
 which is not prime and which also makes the Fletcher check insensitive
 to single byte changes 
\family typewriter
0 <-> 255
\family default
) .
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sum 
\family typewriter
s1
\family default
 is initialized to 1 instead of zero to make the length of the sequence
 part of 
\family typewriter
s2
\family default
, so that the length does not have to be checked separately (any sequence
 of zeroes has a Fletcher checksum of zero)."
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class extends the class 
\family typewriter
Checksum
\family default

 It has a public default constructor, which creates a new instance of the
 
\family typewriter

Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TotalCross provides a Synchronization API to develop conduits, which are
 TotalCross desktop applications that automatically synchronize files from
 your device to your computer and vice-versa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the conduit is actually a TotalCross application, you won't have to
 write a conduit for each device you want to support.
 However, there are a few limitations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Conduits can only be used on Windows 2000 and above, because currently this
 is the only desktop OS supported.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Currently the synchronization API only supports WinCE and PalmOS devices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Its functionality is based on the desktop synchronization software provided
 for your target device, so you're required to have it installed on your
 desktop.
 The right synchronization software depends on the desktop OS and the target
 device OS, as listed below:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
WinCE device and Windows Vista or Seven – requires Windows Mobile Device
 Center version 6.0 and above.

 Windows Mobile 2003 devices and later.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
WinCE device and Windows 2000 or XP – requires Microsoft ActiveSync.
 The version 4.5.0 works with most devices, but some devices may require another
 specific version.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
PalmOS device and Windows – requires the Palm Desktop with the HotSync Manager
 6.0.1.
 The conduit may work with other versions of the HotSync Manager, but the
 version 6.0.1 is recommended.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
A conduit is usually triggered by the desktop synchronization software under
 a specific circumstance.
 Its behavior is slightly different depending on the target device:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
WinCE – The conduit is executed whenever a device is connected to the desktop
 and recognized by the Microsoft ActiveSync or the Windows Mobile Device
 Center.
 No extra interaction is required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
PalmOS – The conduit is executed during the HotSync operation, which must
 be started by the user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Conduit usage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A conduit is usually not executed directly by the user, instead, it is registere
d to be executed when a specific event occurs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
Conduit
\family default
 class already implements methods to register, unregister or configure a
 conduit, that are executed by invoking the conduit executable from the
 command line passing the desired parameter:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00
/rp Registers this conduit for PalmOS devices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00
/up Unregisters this conduit for PalmOS devices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00
/rw Registers this conduit for WinCE devices.

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00
/uw Unregisters this conduit for WinCE devices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00
/c Shows the configuration panel (if available) for this conduit.
\end_layout

Socket
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
Socket
\family default
 class allows you to open TCP/IP connections from your device.
 To be able to establish a connection with a particular server, both the
 server and the device must be connected to a common network (e.g.
 a local network that connects your computers and devices, or the Internet).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\family typewriter
Socket
\family default
 object denotes a client-server connection over a network using the TCP/IP
 protocol, where the device acts as a client, which connects to a specific
 server port.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
Socket
\family default
 class does not provide many methods besides the ones inherited from 
\family typewriter
Stream
\family default
.
 After creating a socket, you'll usually just perform read and write operations,
 closing the socket after you're done.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, streams that handle remote connections are more likely to fail
 due to hardware and communication problems, so we shouldn't handle socket
 operations the same way we do with file operations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In TotalCross, socket's read and write operations are blocking with a timeout
 – that means that socket methods will block the thread until the operation
 is completed, or the timeout for the operation is reached.
 If the operation is completed, the method returns immediately, regardless
 of the amount of time left.
 Otherwise, the method will just return the amount of data processed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's important to notice that no exception is thrown if the method times
 out.
 This is just a way to prevent your thread from being blocked indefinitely
 because of communication problems.
 You may just keep executing the same method until it finishes processing
 all the data.

Usually you should not worry about the read and write timeouts.
 The default values will be fine in most cases.
 However, you may increase the timeout value if you experience problems
 with slow connections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reducing the timeout value is usually a bad idea.
 If your device has a high speed connection, the read and write methods
 should also be fast and return before the timeout is reached.
 However, reducing the timeout value won't give you any benefit, and may
 even decrease your program performance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Methods for read and write operations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
readBytes(byte[]
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

buf) Attempts to read enough bytes from this socket to fill the given buffer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
readLine() Attempts to read a line of text from this socket.
 A line is a sequence of characters delimited by any character lower than
 blank.
 This method correctly handles newlines with

\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList

s) Attempts to write the given string to this socket.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Except for the method 
\family typewriter
readLine()
\family default
, the methods above are just available for convenience and may be replaced
 by read/write calls inherited from

Stream
\family default
.
 This has a cost however - using these methods increases the number of method
 calls for each read/write operation by one (they actually just call the
 
\family typewriter
Stream
\family default
 methods).
 If your application makes heavy use of sockets, you may avoid using these
 methods to improve its performance.

ServerSocket
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class implements server sockets.
 A server socket waits for requests to come in over the network.
 It may then accept the incoming TCP/IP connection and perform some operation
 based on that request, possibly returning a result to the requester.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
ServerSocket

 constructors:
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList

port) Attempts to open a server socket at the specified port number.
 By default, the maximum number of simultaneous connections allowed is 
\family typewriter
DEFAULT_BACKLOG
\family default
 and the default timeout for accept is 
\family typewriter
DEFAULT_SOTIMEOUT
\family default
, and the server is not bound to any specific local address.
 The port number must be between 0 and 65535.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After creating a server socket, you may use the method 
\family typewriter
accept()
\family default
 to wait for incoming connections.
 This method blocks the thread for the amount of time specified by the timeout
 value passed to the constructor, returning a 
\family typewriter
null
\family default
 value when the timeout is over, or until a connection request is received
 and accepted, returning a socket instance representing the new connection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The returned object is always a valid

 instance, that may be used to transfer data between this server and the
 client that requested the connection, and that should be closed when no
 longer needed.

\begin_layout Standard
If the remote method expects any arguments, you must set them using the
 
\family typewriter
setParam()
\family default
 method.
 However, there are several versions of this method to cover different argument
 types.
 Listing all of them would be pointless, so we'll define a generic type
 that we'll refer as 
\family typewriter
<type>
\family default
, and may be one of the of the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

boolean
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter

\begin_layout Standard
So, whenever a SOAP method is described like 
\family typewriter

 each type listed above.
 Other type of parameters can be passed using similar methods.

Basically, TLS allows secured and authenticated communication between two
 components generally so-called client & server.
 It relies on X509 certificates, their associated private keys to encrypt
 and associated public keys to decrypt exchanged data.
 The certificates could be self signed or signed by an Authority known as
 CA (Certification Authority) that have to be trusted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Insofar the subject of SSL based security is well documented on the web,

\begin_layout Standard
The first entry is the private key password.
 The private key is used to sign other certificates to assert they are authentic.
 The private key is protected by a password as a further security because
 the CA private key is a main secret that have to be protected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next you will have to fill in X500 attributes describing the certificate
 subject.
 In our case, we enter information describing the SuperWaba CA (Certification
 Authority).
 Any agent trusting this CA, will authenticate certificates that have been
 signed by it through the CA embedded public key.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now have two files, 
\family typewriter
cakey.pem
\family default
 containing an encrypted version of the CA private key protected by a password
 and 
\family typewriter
cacert.pem
\family default
 containing an X509 certificate embedding the CA public key that could be
 redistributed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, you have to create a text file named 
\family typewriter
ca.srl
\family default
 with the content "00" for certicate signing counting, just execute the
 following command :
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
bash$ echo “00” > ca.srl
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Create a client or server X509 certificate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, you have to generate a new private key.
 SSL supports unencrypted and aes128/256 encrypted private keys.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
bash$ openssl genrsa -aes128 -out mykey.pem 512
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may replace 
\family typewriter
-aes128
\family default
 by 
\family typewriter
-aes256
\family default
 for a stronger cipher, or remove 
\family typewriter
-aes128
\family default
 at all to generate a private key that is not encrypted.
 When you ask for an encrypted key, you have to enter a password used in
 the ciphering.
 The last option represent the key size in bits, values between 512 and
 4096 bits for a higher security are accepted, but always keep in mind that
 higher security implies longer processing times especially critical on
 embedded devices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next you have to generate a certificate request.
 This file could be transmitted to one of the commercial CA companies for
 signing or could be signed by our previously created private CA.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
bash$ openssl req -new -out my.req -key mykey.pem
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Add 
\family typewriter
-x509
\family default
 if you want to generate a self signed certificate if you don't want to
 use a CA at all (in this case, you may name the file 
\family typewriter
mycert.pem
\family default
 rather than 
\family typewriter
my.req
\family default
).
 Insofar, the 
\family typewriter
out
\family default
 file will contain a finalized self-signed certificate rather than a certificate
 request.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Enter all information describing your client or your server component.
 The certificate request will be stored in the file 
\family typewriter
my.req
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we will sign the certificate with the CA.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
bash$ openssl x509 -CA cacert.pem -CAkey cakey.pem -CAserial ca.srl -req -in
 my.req -out mycert.pem -days 1460
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
cacert.pem
\family default
 is the CA certificate, 
\family typewriter
cakey.pem
\family default
 its above created PEM encrypted private key, 
\family typewriter
my.req
\family default
 is the certificate request file generated previously and 
\family typewriter
mycert.pem
\family default
 is the resulting signed certificate that can be used for authentication
 and encryption during 1460 days (4 years).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Principle of an X509 authentication/encryption
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
X509 authentication/encryption is based on public/private key encryption
 that have a great characteristic.
 Indeed, the data ciphered by either key could only be deciphered by the
 other one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A software component that has to be authenticated, such as a secured server,
 may now be configured to deliver to any client the previously generated
 certificate (contained in 
\family typewriter
mycert.pem
\family default
).
 It also has to load the associated certificate private key.
 That private key is used to cipher data transmited to the client.
 On the other side, the client uses the public key embedded in the accepted
 server certificate to decipher the data from the server and cipher the
 data to be sent back to the server so that the server can decipher with
 its private key.
 If the client is configured to trust any certificate that have been signed
 by the signing CA, it will be able to authenticate any certificate using
 the CA public key.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
SSL features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The SSL package supports both PEM and DER encrypted materials.

name "DER (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinguished_Encoding_Rules)"
target "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinguished_Encoding_Rules"

\end_inset

 is an ASN.1 encoding of information, PEM (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Enh
anced_Mail) is a base64 encoding of a DER encoded data with a header "-----BEGIN
 " and a trailer "-----END " followed by a material type name.
 A PEM file may be dencrypted or encrypted with AES128 or AES256 ciphers
 only.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LiteSSL also supports the pkcs8 encoding that is a private key encryption
 format.
 But it supports only one ciphering algorithm that is PBE-SHA1-RC4-128.
 Here is the commandline to convert a PEM encoded private key into a pkcs8
 encoded format.
 Always use the 
\family typewriter
.p8
\family default
 file suffix to identify the pkcs8 format.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
bash$ openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -in mykey.pem -inform PEM -out mykey.p8 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

-outform DER -v1 PBE-SHA1-RC4-128
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You will have to enter a password, that will be required to use the private
 key.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LiteSSL also supports pkcs12 that is a certificate/private key encryption
 format.
 But it supports only one ciphering algorithm that is PBE-SHA1-RC4-128.
 Here is the commandline to convert certificate and its associate encoded
 private key into a pkcs12 encoded format.
 Always use the 
\family typewriter
.p12
\family default
 file suffix to identify the pkcs12 format.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
bash$ openssl pkcs12 -export -in server.pem -out server.p12 -name 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

"myserver" -inkey server.key -certpbe PBE-SHA1-RC4-128 -keypbe 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

PBE-SHA1-RC4-128
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You will have to enter a password, that will be required to use the private
 key embedded in the pkcs12 encoded file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Restrictions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Applet version is implemented on top of SUN's JSSE.
 This TLS implementation has some limitations that prevent the use of some
 security material formats supported by SSL on devices.
 Thus, private keys have to be in pkcs8 format only.
 Moreover, they can't be password protected.
 You have to add the 
\family typewriter
-nocrypt
\family default
 option to the commandline provided above to convert a PEM encoded private
 key to pkcs8 encoding.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
SSL usage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter
SSLUtil
\family default
 class provides functions to get information about the TLS stack layer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first class to instantiate is 
\family typewriter
SSLClient
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
SSLServer
\family default
 (not currently supported).
 This class represents an SSL client or server context both inheriting from
 the 
\family typewriter
SSLCTX
\family default
 class that provides many SSL context common services.
 The main feature concerns the security material loading.
 Use 
\family typewriter
objLoad()
\family default
 to load material from files or memory.
 The arguments of this function are the material type (CA, X509 certificate,
 private keys, etc.), the filename or the memory containing the material,
 and finally a password for private keys loading if they are password based
 encrypted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To succeed the handshake with a server, you have to trust its self-signed
 certificate or trust the CA certificate who signed the server's certificate.
 Use 
\family typewriter
objLoad(SSL_OBJ_X509_CACERT, “cacert.pem”, null)
\family default
 to trust the server's signing CA.
 If the server requires client authentication, you will have to send your
 own client certificate.
 Use 
\family typewriter
objLoad(SSL_OBJ_X509_CERT, “mycert.pem”, null)
\family default
 to load your client certificate and 
\family typewriter
objLoad(SSL_OBJ_RSA_KEY, 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

“mykey.pem”, “pass”)
\family default
 to load the client certificate associated private key protected by the
 
\family typewriter
pass
\family default
 password.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, you have to call 
\family typewriter
connect()
\family default
 on the context instance to create an SSL instance linked with a previously
 created socket.
 The SSL handshake starts immediatly to try to establish an authenticated/cipher
ed communication.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The SSL handshake succeeded if it the 
\family typewriter
connect()
\family default
 call returns an SSL instance and the 
\family typewriter
handshakeStatus()
\family default
 function call on that instance returns 
\family typewriter
SSL_OK
\family default
.
 Consequently, you may check the subject of the peer certificate with the
 
\family typewriter
getCertificateDN()
\family default
 call to identify it and the context could be used to write and read ciphered
 data until the “dispose” call terminates the SSL communication.
 The peer receives a protocol alert to signal a link shutdown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The SSL write of data returns the amount of bytes written or an error if
 the writing failed.
 The SSL read of data may return 
\family typewriter
SSL_OK
\family default
 that indicates that the read is not yet terminated and may be called again
 to achieve the reading of a block of decipherable data.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This package has the following classes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Address 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class represents an Internet e-mail address using the syntax of RFC822.
 Typical address syntax is of the form 
\family typewriter
user@host.domain
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
Personal Name
\family default
 
\family typewriter
<user@host.domain>
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class has two fields:
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
address The e-mail address, which must have the form shown above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
personal The name of the user e-mail address.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class has just a constructor:
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
Address(String
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

address,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

String
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

personal) Creates a new 
\family typewriter
Address
\family default
 object, which represents an Internet e-mail address.
 The address must be in RFC822 format.
 If the given address is 
\family typewriter
null
\family default
 or does not contain the character 
\family typewriter
@
\family default
, an 
\family typewriter
AddressException
\family default
 is thrown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class has just one method, 
\family typewriter
toString()
\family default
, which returns a string representation of an 
\family typewriter
Address
\family default
 object.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
DataContentHandler 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is an abstract class that defines the basic interface for implementations
 of 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

DataContentHandler
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
BinaryContentHandler 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class is an implementation of 
\family typewriter
DataContentHandler
\family default
 that handles MIME types handled as base64 encoded byte arrays.
 It also handle streams, reading from the input stream on demand to avoid
 excessive memory load.
 This will usually be slower than reading the whole content of the stream
 to a byte array and using it as the 
\family typewriter
Part
\family default
 content.
 This class just has the default constructor and one method:
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
writeTo(Object
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

obj,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

String
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

mimeType,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Stream
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

stream) Writes a binary object in the given stream.
 
\family typewriter
obj
\family default
 must be an instance of 
\family typewriter
Part
\family default
.
 The second parameter is ignored in this method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
TextContentHandler
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class is an implementation of 
\family typewriter
DataContentHandler
\family default
 that handles textual (not encoded) MIME types.
 This class is similar to the previous one, except for the fact that if
 
\family typewriter
obj
\family default
 is not a 
\family typewriter
Part
\family default
 in the 
\family typewriter
writeTo()
\family default
 method, it will be transformed into a 
\family typewriter
String
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
DataHandler 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class maps a MIME type into an instance of a 
\family typewriter
DataContentHandler
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class only has a default constructor and the following methods:
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
addDataContentHandler(DataContentHandler
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

dataContentHandler,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

String
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

mimeType) May be used to add an user-defined 
\family typewriter
DataContentHandler
\family default
, associated to a specific MIME type.
 A list of MIME types can be found in 
\begin_inset CommandInset href

target "http://www.webmaster-toolkit.com/mime-types.shtml"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
MailSession
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class is used to store properties used by the messaging API.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The SMTP protocol provider supports the following properties, which may
 be set in the MailSession object.
 The properties are always set as strings; the Type column describes how
 the string is interpreted.
 For example, use 
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

props.put("mail.smtp.port", "888"); 
\end_layout

\end_inset

to set the 
\family typewriter

FORM_DATA
\family default
 (
\family typewriter
form-data
\family default
).
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The "multipart/mixed" (and other similar types) media type was explicitly
 designed to formalize the transport of related collections of body entities
 in the same message ...
 the classic use case being email attachments.
 These media types were explicitly designed to be more general, so they
 do not impose any use-case-specific restrictions on things like requiring
 certain headers with certain parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
addPart(Part
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

\end_inset

content,
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

String
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

mimeType) A convenience method for setting this part's content with the
 given content MIME type.
 Note that a 
\family typewriter
DataContentHandler
\family default
 class for the specified type should be available, otherwise the content
 will be handled by the 
\family typewriter
BinaryContentHandler
\family default
, which writes the content as a base 64 encoded string.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
setContent(Multipart
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

multipart) This method sets the given 
\family typewriter
Multipart
\family default
 object as this part's content.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList

text) A convenience method that sets the given 
\family typewriter
totalcross.lang.String
\family default
 as this part's content with a MIME type of "text/plain".
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
writeTo(Stream
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

stream) Writes this part to the given stream.
 The output is typically an aggregation of the 
\family typewriter
Part
\family default
 attributes and an appropriately encoded byte stream from its 'content'.
 Classes that extends the 
\family typewriter
Part
\family default
 class decide on the appropriate encoding algorithm to be used.
 The received stream is typically used for sending.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
getContent() Returns the content of this part.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Folder
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
Folder
\family default
 is an abstract class that represents a folder for mail messages.
 Subclasses implement protocol specific 
\family typewriter
Folder
\family default
s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class doesn't have a public constructor and has the following methods:
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
open() Open this 
\family typewriter
Folder
\family default
.
 This method is valid only on 
\family typewriter
Folder
\family default
s that can contain 
\family typewriter
Message
\family default
s and that are closed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
getMessageCount() Get total number of messages in this folder.
 This method can be invoked on a closed folder.
 However, note that for some folder implementations, getting the total message
 count can be an expensive operation involving actually opening the folder.
 In such cases, a provider can choose not to support this functionality
 in the closed state, in which case this method must return -1.
 Clients invoking this method on a closed folder must be aware that this
 is a potentially expensive operation.
 Clients must also be prepared to handle a return value of -1 in this case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
getDeleteMessageCount() Get total number of deleted messages in this folder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList
\labelwidthstring 0
getMessages() Get all 
\family typewriter
Message
\family default
 objects from this folder.
 Returns an empty array if the folder is empty.
 Clients can use 
\family typewriter
Message
\family default
 objects (instead of sequence numbers) as references to the messages within
 a folder; this method supplies the 
\family typewriter
Message
\family default
 objects to the client.
 Folder implementations are expected to provide light-weight 
\family typewriter
Message
\family default
 objects, which get filled on demand.
 This implementation uses 
\family typewriter
getMessage()
\family default
 to get 
\family typewriter
Message
\family default
 objects from 1 till the message count.
 It returns an array of 
\family typewriter
Message
\family default
 objects.
 If the folder is empty, it returns an empty array.
\end_layout

\begin_layout FieldList

 and end inclusive.
 Note that message numbers start at 1, not 0.
 This implementation uses
\family typewriter

 Messages are numbered starting at 1 through the total number of messages
 in the folder.
 Note that the message number for a particular message can change during
 a session if other messages in the folder are deleted and the folder is
 expunged.
 Unlike

The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a specification for the encryption
 of electronic data established by the U.S.
 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2002.
 The algorithm described by AES is a symmetric-key algorithm, meaning the
 same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting the data.
 AES is based on a design principle known as a substitution-permutation
 network, and is fast in both software and hardware.

\begin_layout Standard
This class implements the RSA cryptographic cipher.
 It is similar to 
\family typewriter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
RSA is an algorithm for public-key cryptography that is based on the presumed
 difficulty of factoring large integers, the factoring problem.
 RSA stands for Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, who first publicly
 described it in 1977.
 A user of RSA creates and then publishes the product of two large prime
 numbers, along with an auxiliary value, as their public key.
 The prime factors must be kept secret.
 Anyone can use the public key to encrypt a message, but with currently
 published methods, if the public key is large enough, only someone with
 knowledge of the prime factors can feasibly decode the message.
 Whether breaking RSA encryption is as hard as factoring is an open question
 known as the RSA problem.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm is a widely used cryptographic hash function
 that produces a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value.
 MD5 has been employed in a wide variety of security applications, and is
 also commonly used to check data integrity.

SHA1Digest 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class implements the SHA-1 message digest algorithm.
 It is similar to 
\family typewriter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In cryptography, SHA-1 is a cryptographic hash function.
 SHA stands for "secure hash algorithm".
 The three SHA algorithms are structured differently and are distinguished
 as SHA-0, SHA-1, and SHA-2.
 SHA-1 is very similar to SHA-0, but corrects an error in the original SHA
 hash specification that led to significant weaknesses.
 The SHA-0 algorithm was not adopted by many applications.
 SHA-2 on the other hand significantly differs from the SHA-1 hash function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
SHA-1 is the most widely used of the existing SHA hash functions, and is
 employed in several widely used applications and protocols, including TLS
 and SSL, PGP, SSH, S/MIME, and IPsec.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
SHA256Digest

\begin_layout Standard
This class implements the SHA-256 message digest algorithm.
 It is similar to 
\family typewriter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
SHA-256 is part of a family of two similar hash functions with different
 block sizes, known as SHA-256 and SHA-512.
 They differ in the word size; SHA-256 uses 32-bit words where SHA-512 uses
 64-bit words.
 There are also truncated versions of each standardized, known as SHA-224
 and SHA-384.
 All of them are part of the SHA-2.

OPTIMIZATION TRICKS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapterstar
Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this small, but highly important chapter, is to teach you
 how to improve your Java application's speed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The TotalCross VM has an interpreter, which makes it a little slow for certain
 types of applications.
 It is not feasible to program in the same way for 300MHz (a typical PDA)
 and 3000 MHz processors (a typical desktop).
 By following the tricks presented in this tutorial, you'll be able to improve
 your application's performance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TotalCross uses the virtual machine of BlackBerry (there's no C development
 kit for it, so we can't build our virtual machine on BlackBerry; instead,
 we only ported the TotalCross classes to run on the top of the RIM Java
 API).
 This is the reason why the BlackBerry timings are different.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These tips and tricks can make a very big difference in speed not only when
 running your program in PDAs, but also on desktop systems.
 Most of them can be used in any Java environment, and are actually referenced
 in other books and tutorials, but others are explicitly TotalCross optimization
 tricks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are some proof timings (measured in microseconds – µ = 1 second /
 1,000,000) near a clock bullet.
 They are always shown per iteration, ie, taken the total time and divided
 by the number or iterations.
 All tests were performed in the following devices:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Palm OS: Palm Centro, 312MHz – named Palm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Windows Mobile: Toshiba G900, 400MHz – named Win
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_layout Chapter
The Tricks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Avoid method calls.
 Method calls in TotalCross (and, actually, in any platform or virtual machine)
 are extremely expensive when comparing to in-lined code.
 This is the most important optimization trick and several other tricks
 inherit from this one.
 Lets see some common mistakes that people make:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The same care can be taken with an array's 
\family typewriter
length
\family default
 property.
 It always takes extra time to get the field, so it's better to assign it
 to a temporary variable and use it in the loop, or use the previous suggestions.

Avoid using get and set methods.
 This may go against standard object oriented practices, but in small Java

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note about final classes: in the first JDK versions (up to 1.1.x), making
 the get/set methods final or making the whole class final would make the
 compiler inline the methods when using the 
\family typewriter
-O
\family default
 compiler option.
 From JDK 1.2.x and beyond this no longer holds true.
 We plan, however, to make the TotalCross' deployer inline methods, thus
 re-allowing the programmer to use get/set methods.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Any other methods that are used in a loop are good candidates to be inlined
 directly.
 But please have good sense when doing this.
 There's no need to inline all your program in one big block.
 Just make sure you optimize the very inner loop and that's it.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Avoid using Interfaces.
 If you have an interface that is frequently used (maybe in a loop) in your
 application, change it to an abstract class, if possible.
 This is necessary because interface methods cannot be dynamically bound
 by the VM, thus each method call must be looked up in the methods table
 each time it is called.
 In normal and in abstract classes, the method is looked up only once and
 then its address is bound and used in all subsequent calls.

 Not always the best approach for one platform is also the best for the

 array provided by

 It does not eliminate the stack trace if your application catches the

In short, the above means the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When you catch an exception as 
\family typewriter
Throwable
\family default
, you may print the stack trace using 
\family typewriter
printStackTrace()
\family default
.
 Otherwise, it assumes your code handled the exception properly and discards
 the stack trace.
 In this case 
\family typewriter
printStackTrace()
\family default
 will print nothing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When you catch an exception as 
\family typewriter
Throwable
\family default
, you don't actually stop the exception propagation.
 It only lets you inspect the exception for debugging purposes.
 The exception is still propagated to the caller method!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Catching as 
\family typewriter
Exception
\family default
 (or a subclass of it) allows you to stop the propagation, but does not
 give you access to the stack trace.

\begin_layout Section
Configuring Eclipse to Run and Debug TotalCross Programs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a guide to help you to setup the Eclipse IDE (www.eclipse.org) to
 develop TotalCross programs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because this isn't a guide for Eclipse or Java, it assumes the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Java JDK 6 is installed and configured.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The Eclipse IDE with Java Development Tools installed.
 Please notice this guide was created using the Eclipse Ganymede (version
 3.4.x) package “Eclipse IDE for Java Developers”, and the steps presented
 here may not be valid for other versions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
We'll refer to the TotalCross location as TotalCross SDK.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We'll use the UIGadgets sample that comes with the SDK to skip the programming
 and focus on the project setup:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Create a new Java Project: Open the menu File and click on New > Java Project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Choose a project name for your project and click on Finish.
 We'll use UIGadgets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Click on “+” to expand the project and right-click on the folder “src” and
 choose “Import...”.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
On the new “Import” dialog shown, click on “+” to expand the folder “General”,
 select “File System” and click “Next >”.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now write the complete file path to the UIGadgets example, or use “Browse”
 to navigate to the file system.
 Our source is located at 
\family typewriter
TotalCrossSDK/src/tc/samples/ui/gadgets
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
After inputing the source location, check the file 
\family typewriter
UIGadgets.java
\family default
 on the right panel; Below you can see the default input folder is 
\family typewriter
UIGadgets/src
\family default
, change it to 
\family typewriter
UIGadgets/src/tc/ samples/ui/gadgets
\family default
 and click on “Finish”.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now we can see our project has 
\family typewriter
tc.samples.ui.gadgets.UIGadgets.java
\family default
 on it, but it is also displaying several build errors.
 To fix this, right-click on the project and choose “Properties”.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
On the left panel, select “Java Build Path”; Then, on the right panel, click
 on the “Libraries” tab and on the button “Add External JARs...”; Browse your
 file system to 
\family typewriter
TotalCrossSDK/dist
\family default
 and select the file 
\family typewriter
tc.jar
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now the “Libraries” tab should also show the 
\family typewriter
tc.jar
\family default
.
 Click on “+” to expand it and select “Javadoc location”.
 Now click on the button “Edit...” to open a new dialog, then browse your file
 system and select the 
\family typewriter
TotalCrossSDK/docs/html/
\family default
 directory and press “Ok” to confirm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Back to the “Libraries” tab, select “Source attachment” and click on the
 button “Edit...” to open a new dialog, then browse your file system and select
 the 
\family typewriter
TotalCrossSDK/src
\family default
 directory and press “Ok” to confirm.
 This finishes the build path configuration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Look again at the left panel and select “Java Compiler”.
 Check the option “Enable project specific settings” and change the “Compiler
 compliance level” to “1.3”.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Press “Ok” to confirm and close the “Properties” dialog.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Re-build the project and the build errors should all be gone (skip this
 step if your Eclipse is configured to Build automatically).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Logging errors Example
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have developped a way to automatically generate an error log.
 In our case, the log is sent by email on each data synchronization.
 Thus, it is possible to catch errors that occur when the application is
 in production and the user can't send the device to us.
 The option described here uses commands that are available in version 1.52,
 released on March 20.
 The code written here is NOT in the SDK.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Firstly, you need to centralize all exception processing to throw them into
 a file.
 We must also find out if the program aborted for some reason.
 With the class below you can do this for Android.
 You can change it for other devices:

Observations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The 
\family typewriter
GerenciamentoDeErros
\family default
 class allows logging everything.
 AVOID THAT: only errors should be there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In our synchronization, we send the log error using a servlet; if you preffer
 using a webservice, you must implement something different.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In the server, we get the report and send it by e-mail directly to the developer
 support service.
 If the report has tcvmlib errors, you should open a request in our support
 service with the error log and addicional information to help us to reproduce
 the errors.
