<h2>TotalCross 3.1 build 2444</h2>
* now in tc.Deploy the tcz is automatically splitted when it reaches the methods and fields limits. You can pass a huge jar file and tc.Deploy will split it automatically into some tczs.<br>
* upgraded compiler and source level support to Java 1.7, including enum, switch with String, for each, and generics.<br>
* added support for the following classes in TotalCross: AbstractCollection,AbstractList,AbstractMap,AbstractQueue,AbstractSequentialList,AbstractSet,ArrayList,Arrays,BitSet,Collection,Collections,Comparator,ConcurrentModificationException,Deque,Dictionary,Enum,Enumeration,HashMap,HashSet,IdentityHashMap,InvalidDateException,Iterator,LinkedHashMap,LinkedHashSet,LinkedList,List,ListIterator,Map,NavigableMap,NavigableSet,NoSuchElementException,PriorityQueue,Properties,Queue,RandomAccess,Set,SortedMap,SortedSet,TreeMap,TreeSet.<br>
* Note that Vector and Hashtable does not support generics; use ArrayList and HashMap instead.<br>
* added many more methods from String and StringBuffer. Didnt add methods that uses CharSequence. Also, methods that use Regex will be fixed later.<br>
* added clone support (except for arrays).<br>
* added json support<br>
* added back Windows CE/Mobile support (only ARM processors).<br>
* fixed many crashes when using sockets, sqlite and zlib on concurrent threads. fixed some java memory leaks<br>
* added some new traces to Vm.tweak to help finding memory leaks and also to print methods being called; see comments below.<br>

. updated sqlite to 3.8.7.1<br>

. fixed npe; geolocator may be null at gpsclose.<br>
. fixed SQLiteUtil not correctly returning the date or datetime values on getStrings. SQLite has a problem (not sure if its a bug) where it returns DATE for both DATE and DATETIME types, so this method returns the correct correspondence: DATE for date and TIME for DATETIME (remember that in TotalCross, a Time object also contains the date).<br>
